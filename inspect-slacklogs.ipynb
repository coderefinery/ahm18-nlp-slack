      "2. might be wise to talk to Dan Still (Glenna ll) about having e.g. gitlab via Glenna\n",

      "a). the IDE (PyCharm) part is OK\n",
      "b). the DevOps part can be taken away (Vagrant) this time, is because of time limits it will be mostly talk and little show session\n",
      "<@U2K0EGSC8> we’ve had one windows user for next week’s workshop who couldn’t get the make installation to work. it complained that msys-1.0.dll was missing. she managed to install another make successfully though from <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/install.html>  (gnu make 3.81).\n",
      "maybe good to add to installation instructions for future workshops as a backup solution\n",

      "i was thinking about it but felt it was overkill and that nobody would like to have outdated install doc but i think you have a point, if we move things around or phase modules out they could be harder to reproduce - it is easy for us to add the install stuff to our museum\n",

       "u'is the name now official ? if yes , then i will set up a rudimentary website . this would help me to contact people , then i have a link to refer them to . <@u0kv7fvnv> do you have any connections to <https://www . esciencecenter . nl> or eu open science cloud ? i just met barend mons who is involved in those efforts at a high level , as well as heads up elixir nl . he says they\\'re trying to get rid of \"professorware\" . would this be a useful connection for you ? thanks joel . so far no connection but i will take contact . this would be a very useful connection . thanks ! how would you like to interact in this stage ? getting input on important aspects of setting up this activity ? finding useful ways of interacting in the future ? i am today setting up the coderefinery website with some general information . then i could just write to barend so that they know about us . or , if you like , i could write to introduce you . that way he\\u2019ll know precisely who you are from the start . whichever way you prefer . it would be great if you could send a short email . if you like you can wait a day until i have the website up . then you can also send a link and this helps with the context . will let you know . thank you . super ! just give me a heads up . now a pilot website is up: <http://coderefinery . org> . thanks to <@u0a9nv7px> for good input . suggestions always welcome <@u050w0wap> - the looks will change and we will also soon add more meat to the bones . looking real nice :simple_smile: . i\\u2019ll look more into it when i can find the time . thanks ! thanks for writing the letter ! do you think it looks ok ? should i send it to barend ? looks great - yes . thank you ! done ! thanks ! great job with the webpage radovan ! looking at it i got the immediate impression that there\\u2019s a lot more behind it than just that starter page (but there isn\\u2019t , is it ? ) is that your web design skills showing ? the neic web page has a number of nasty design issues that i\\u2019d love to hear the opinion of someone skilled on whether we could hammer into shape . there is indeed not much there yet . but soon more . next steps are to add links and create connections . then to aggregate interesting courses and material which is already available . the design will change , too . and probably also the backend . now it\\'s a simple static one-pager . and it is true that i am very interested in web stuff so i would be happy to discuss and help out with the neic web page . awesome . do you have some time for a quick chat today , say about 10 ? btw we have a <#c0mtddd27> channel here as well where we discuss wiki and web stuff . great ! i will follow it . <@u0kv7fvnv>: did you have time to meet ? ... say 10:30 or something ? today 10:30 ? yes . i have another meeting at 11:00 so it would have to be before that . ok great ! this shouldn\\'t take much time . i\\'m ready to go whenever you are , if you\\'re conscientious about your next meeting . coderfinery hangout ? we can use this temp one: <https://plus . google . com/hangouts/_/m5ex3uvi7fekzmsidbgy5ixvrme> . i am ready now too . btw is it \"code refinery\" , or \"coder finery\" , like , you know , a real ancient bsd t-shirt ? this is the temp theme used in <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> for the moment: <http://www . gettemplate . com/demo/progressus/> . nice . one tip: if you\\'re looking to redesign your site and you want a nice splash image , one thing that nordforsk does really well is photos and photography , so they might be able to find something that graphically sells your story . agree completely . there will be photos and soon also many success stories . this is super important . joel: can we also have a <http://coderefinery . neic . no|coderefinery . neic . no> or even more needed right now <http://glenna . neic . no|glenna . neic . no> ? @joel . <@u0a9nv7px>: i guess ? try asking in <#c0mtddd27> . i don\\'t know how <http://neic . no|neic . no> is set up . petter should know . as to <http://coderefinery . neic . no|coderefinery . neic . no> , this can be done but what i want to avoid are several websites . to avoid that , they could all point to one . but then the question is why even having several domains . this can be confusing for users/clients . we should discuss what to put at each website . the policy so far is to keep all most up-to-date public info at the external wiki (as appropriate) with the website as just a nice webfront . just so we have \"one right place\" for outsiders to look for neic stuff . we can discuss it . my initial plan was to put most info into <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> and keep the info in the public wiki minimal . basically just linking to the project page . i understand the benefit of wikis since they lower the barrier to edit . but what i don\\'t like about them is the looks . wikis look like back to the 90ies . also i want to <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> and the soon to be created documentation and tutorials to eventually become community-driven . this is impossible on a wiki where you need to have access to . the only solution that allows that is one where you don\\'t require write access and rather contribute via fork-pull-requests . this sounded a bit absolute . i meant only solution that i know of to scale to community size in practice . fair enough . the wiki is purposely one-way and is feature rich and multifunctional enough for its contributor base . but the neic policy for working routines is to use your head , and use what works at all occasions , and not get stuck in local optima . one way to see it is that <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> is in fact a delivery object . we should discuss it . one thing that needs to be clear is that this project belongs to neic . we need to see how to make that very visible . yes , there is a whole slew of discussion to be had around that (referring back to our web meeting earlier today) . let\\'s pick up by voice monday or tuesday . <@u0a9nv7px>: would you like <#c0ne022ta> chat history to be logged ? not sure if it isn\\'t already by default or if we would have to invite our logger first . joel: do you know or do we have to ask in the webchannel ? no , it is not done by default . <@u069f8tst> can set it up for you if you ask . sorry didn\\'t give you full context . joel asked me . personally i don\\'t need the logs but i thought i asked you michaela , too . iow i don\\'t need them but i have no strong opinion against them if they are useful for somebody . your call . from my perspective logging is not necessary . but i am perfectly fine with logging if <@u0a9nv7px> prefers the history to be logged . good read with high relevance to this project: <http://www . economist . com/news/science-and-technology/21695377-professors-unprofessional-programs-have-created-new-profession-more ? frsc=dg%7ca> . i like it ! spaghettiuntanglery !? :grinning: . i will contact the interviewed persons to have them as contact and for their contacts . interesting side aspect to me , has anyone learnt a lesson to be applied to (professional) management of scientific data ? <@u0kv7fvnv>: <https://wiki . neic . no/w/ext/index . php ? title=coderefinery-sg-meeting-2016-04-04&amp;action=history> hab gesehen du hast gerade noch was ge\\xe4ndert , schickst du die upgedated agenda raus ? i have swapped two lines . i will send it out just so that it is clear . . <@u0a9nv7px> &amp; <@u0kv7fvnv>: good luck with today\\u2019s meeting ! thank you ! welcome all to the channel . good read: <http://da-data . blogspot . no/2016/04/stealing-googles-coding-practices-for . html> . neat ! <http://www . rse . ac . uk/conf2016> . hey hans ! is that your new office ? <http://www . nytimes . com/2016/05/22/opinion/sunday/to-write-software-read-novels . html> . i once had an argument with a fellow developed who claimed we were not paid to create works of art - i told him not to worry - even if he tried it wouldn\\'t be art :-) . so at which end of the quality spectrum do you dip into the art bucket ? my code could be considered neo-deconstructivist , i guess . . joel , my view is that code is rarely art - but i sure want you to try . :slightly_smiling_face: i have seen a lot of jackson pollock code lately . not to forget botero apps . :slightly_smiling_face: . :(){ :|:&amp; };: . <https://en . wikipedia . org/wiki/talk%3afork_bomb#: . 28 . 29 . 7b_: . 7c: . 26_ . 7d . 3b>: . its art ! its art you people ! its art ! my art ! nice . _looks at code_ oh no , i arted . although obviously not in the sense that i meant above , i would actually consider some of the stuff submitted to ioccc art . i agree . those are amazing . good morning ! you have the capacity to learn from your mistakes . you will learn a lot today . good morning ! it\\'s always such a joy that i wake up in the morning and there\\'s work to do . <@u0a9nv7px> inviter me to the sg meeting tomorrow . i find <https://wiki . neic . no/wiki/coderefinery-sg-meeting-2016-06-14> . any documents ? i can participate until lunch . . i will link the project plan draft in a minute . i am working on it right now and it will undergo changes before 1 pm so if you have time . in the afternoon , it is better to wait until 1 pm . added link to project plan draft (under construction): <https://wiki . neic . no/wiki/coderefinery-sg-meeting-2016-06-14#documents> . ok , thanks ! <@u0kv7fvnv>: is this a freezed version or this just readonly to the normal one ? read-only , not freezed . any predictions on participation tomorrow ? how many are booked with swedish sas pilots ? so far it looks good , i think . so booked with sas are: rossen , gerd , radovan and lene , but the same flights for tomorrow were not affected today , so there is some hope . gerd and lene even on the same flight . my mob just in case for tomorrow: +47 967 52 679 . would of course be stupid if some of us spend unnecessary time on airports tomorrow and the rest have a half meeting . should we go virtual right from the start . but we have so few physical meetings , they are so important . i\\'m undecided . +46 700 90 7891 btw for those you don\\'t have my mobile number yet . 454 is affected today , isn\\u2019t it ? at least it isn\\u2019t on the list of flights not affected . oh , i missed that . fuck . sorry . i wonder if sas will refund the ticket if your flight isn\\u2019t affected , but your meeting is cancelled due to the strike . maybe fastest do ask them via facebook . i have never had a facebook account in my life . just to get an overview: if the situation tomorrow is the same as the situation today: who will not be able to attend live ? it seems that at least gerd and lene , right ? yeah . ok before we go into cancelling and reimbursements , would it be more advantageous to have few of us live and few of us joining through video or would it be globally better (for the moment disregarding money) to move everybody to virtual ? in terms of ease of discussions and results . my internal info says that sas will keep on striking since it is em and it is now it hurts most . afaics we have three/four options: 1) live+virtual , 2) purely virtual , 3) postpone to another live meeting , 4) 2+3 . option 3 could be cheapest since we would just rebook tickets but time is pressing and we need to meet before the summer . michaela , what is your preference ? i am skeptical that sas would refund flights that are not affected by the strike . you could do a quick doodle to see if we can agree on another date . will do - will send it out via mail , not sure everybody is following this channel . <@u0kv7fvnv> , disregard the the first of my two doodle replies . <@u053hjh7j>: ok i deleted the first . ah - that list of flights not affected is for flights to/from sweden . sk454 departed as scheduled today . that\\'s good news . it seems we should be good then and do not need to move the meeting , do i see that right ? unless the situation changes tomorrow , we should be good . ok . sk454 appears to be on time . . <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1bhdygiigkrxkzx4m3qgh3fijggvmtz-dbre1th9yo64/edit> live minutes . oslo airport depatures information: <https://avinor . no/flyplass/oslo/flyinformasjon/avganger/> . <http://epubs . siam . org/doi/abs/10 . 1137/15m1014784> molns is based on ipython and provides an interactive programming platform for development of sharable and reproducible distributed parallel computational experiments . interesting ? i think jupyter is generally super interesting . <http://www . software . ac . uk/resources/guides/software-management-plans> software management plans as part of data mangagment plans . interesting ! could be part of what we have planned as consulting so far to help researchers to write such software management plans as well . i agree . i have personally suffered several times being part of projects that have allocated too little resources for software development and maintenance because the mindset is often that software is like a publication , you write it , you publish it , and that\\'s it . and we know that this is not how it works . crazy mindset , can\\u2019t imagine any cs would think like that :wink: . agree :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u0kv7fvnv>: you on vacation this week , or do we meet now at <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/hqwgd5demk4zqgxiozbj32yaxma> ? sorry was in another meeting with lene - just wrote you an email . i am in principle still on vacation but i would like to discuss today . <@u0kv7fvnv>: ok , i\\'m still online , just join . ok i will be there in two mins . hey , nice to join you . welcome ! <http://wssspe . researchcomputing . org . uk/wssspe4/> . interesting workshop right next to <http://www . rse . ac . uk/conf2016> . <http://classicprogrammerpaintings . com/post/148509292489/new-employee-learns-that-his-teams-codebase-has> :-) . nice ! <http://oicr-gsi . github . io/robust-paper/> . <https://swcarpentry . github . io/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/> . (1st url) what if the code does not compile on other systems ? it\\u2019s strange that they use such a generic title while they mostly apply to bioinf software . good comment - i am now reading through it and will email them suggestions (also this one) . they are indeed from the bioinf crowd but they look forward to get comments from outside their community . the use of \\u201crobust\\u201d is telling (to me) , i think it has a specific meaning in cs . yeah , the only item that seems remotely related to \\u201crobustness\\u201d is item 9 . here my personal comments that i sent to the authors (sorry long post): . 1) in several places you mention and focus on \"running\" the software , e . g . \"impossible to run outside\" , \"difference between running and being robust\" , \"tests to show to that it actually runs\" . this is good and understandable in the python/r communities but in fortran/c/c++-heavy physics/chemistry communities building the software can be a barrier for users and is of huge concern for portability (so is running but before the running comes the building) . if you want to mention this and go this way , then you could recommend to use standard build tools (make , autotools , cmake; the last would be my fav) and not home-cooked configuration and build scripts . 2) [end of intro] \"enough tests to show that it actually runs\" . it is a good point and i understand why you emphasize this but for users and in particular computing centers who install software for users it is very important to easily verify whether the software is expected to produce correct results . i feel that this is slightly more of a concern for compiled codes than for interpreted languages . 3) you may want to mention in section 3 (meaningful version number) to always print the version of the code and all its dependencies in the output file(s) to enhance reproducibility . you do mention this in section 8 but before i arrived there i thought it got left out . 4) in section 5 you recommend to avoid depending on packages which are installed locally and may not be available to the user and not listed as dependency . my recommendation to avoid this is to always install dependencies through the file that you recommend one paragraph up (e . g . requirements . txt in python) . then you \"dogfood\" on your own requirements . txt file and make sure that you don\\'t forget a dependency . in other words i never install a dependency with \"pip install package\" but always through \"pip install -r requirements . txt\" . this makes my local installations documented . also i always use and recommend virtualenv (or the corresponding alternative in other languages) . this enhances portability . 5) section 9: for codes that produce mainly numbers (many physics and quantum chemistry codes run for days and produce very few floating point results) , the tests should test with tolerance for limited numerical precision . this does not have to be explicitly stated since it may be part of \"output must be easy to interpret\" but i mention this anyway since this is a nuisance with many codes in my community . 6) still section 9: other motivations (and my main motivations for tests): - tests simplify external contributions (thus help make the code live longer) , as an external contributor i am scared to modify a code without tests , as a maintainer i am scared to accept changes if the changes are not tested - complicated code is hard to test , simple code is easy to test -&gt; tests will automatically guide me towards good (= simple) code structure (simple is again good for external contributions) 7) not completely sure what \"robust\" means in the title (but i think i know) . if it means sustainable then external contributions are important . for external contributions it is very useful to clearly mark what is api and what are internals . in many codes this is not clear . also a contribution guide is then very useful for external people . 8) to minimize code complexity i would recommend the unix philosophy to create programs which aim at doing one thing and one thing only (and well) . i have written and seen many programs that tried to do many things , \"everything\" , and eventually crushed under their own complexity . it is better to keen functionality minimal and to leverage small units by composition into new ideas . again following unix philosophy . <http://www . benlaken . com/blog/ ? id=27> . i\\u2019m missing a key term in that post \\u2026 algorithm . it seems everyone is so focused on fiddling with coding issues , that they miss the important ones . maybe it\\u2019s just a result of wrong education (starting from school , to bachelor/master and finally phd studies) . the reality is that many researchers who grew up outside cs don\\'t think so much about algorithms . very often , the algorithms are simple . the researchers struggle often with the most basic issues like how to get variable x from location a to location b without completely messing up the code . <http://wssspe . researchcomputing . org . uk> . (now at wssspe4 workshop) . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u0a9nv7px> can you invite harsha from my team ( <mailto:sriharsha . vathsavayi@csc . fi|sriharsha . vathsavayi@csc . fi> ) , he\\'s also interested . harsha is the given name ? @jyrsa , <@u0kv7fvnv>: done . he can change the name if i got it wrong . i think the canonical answer is that harsha is the name he wishes to be called by ... great - welcome harsha . please feel free to post things here and share stuff - i am now at wssspe4 , super highly relevant for us - i accumulate contacts and links to projects , will share asap . thank you bast and hi all ! sure ! hi @harsha , welcome on board ! :-) . i don\\'t know if everyone is familiar with the metaphor \"technical debt\" . one reason for accumulation of technical debt is not following best practices . new and interesting topic in software engineering research . <https://www . linkedin . com/pulse/20140831034825-12645346-technical-debt-breaking-the-poor-development-cycle> . thanks for the link . hello team , a little homework before our next meeting . please check <https://github . com/coderefinery/stuff/blob/master/workshop-checklist . md> and <https://github . com/coderefinery/stuff/blob/master/pre-course-survey . md> and prepare comments/suggestions/corrections . tell me what is missing , tell me what makes no sense . you can also edit files directly or file a pr . the pre-course survey needs improvement - it is not a well designed survey yet . it is important that we design it well since the data that we will accumulate will be very valuable . <http://meet . csc . fi|meet . csc . fi> froze on us , we go for hangouts: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/net3ztm5urhhdffr6cnijx2qjie> . in the meantime a suggestion for the process of planning and debriefing courses <https://docs . google . com/presentation/d/1fm5txyfr3qwqqnu_lzayf2ni_jce95lwxzqwrqiczm4/edit> . sorry i have realized that you have no write perms to the minutes - i will fix this and let you know . jyry: your suggestion for the planning/debriefing process is very good - i suggest that you try to reformulate it into a checklist that we can use as reference . together with \"my\" checklist this can then form a basis for a workshop manual . this manual can then eventually even become public document on the website imo . initially we can keep it in the google doc drive that i will set up this afternoon . jyry feel also free to add it via pr to <https://github . com/coderefinery/stuff/blob/master/workshop-checklist . md> (i will later find a better name than \"stuff\") . can you please send me or message me the email address with which i can invite you to the shared folder ? if you are uncomfortable with entangling your google account with work stuff , please let me know and we will find another way . got nikolai\\'s and jyry\\'s addresses in the request from this morning which i have missed . have updated the checklist: <https://github . com/coderefinery/stuff/blob/master/workshop-checklist . md> - jyry after some thought i recommend you merge your suggestions directly with that document - feel free to reorganize it . also the survey questions are updated - please improve , comment , pr . sorry everybody - the github repos were read-only until now - now you can also write to them . temporary logo: <https://twitter . com/coderefine> - this is not the real final logo but it is better than the default twitter egg which looks just bad . i actually bounced into \"@coderefine\\xbb on twitter a saw the egg , a sure sign of a sparingly used twitter account :slightly_smiling_face: . yes the egg is a bad sign - we have a better logo in the pipeline . i have been caught up with lots of other work but now the website will move forward . the website and twitter presence is super important in this project so i am now investing some time into it . @coderefine just hatched during the nordunet conference , so the egg is still suitable this month . :-) . :slightly_smiling_face: . hello team , i am travelling next week and will not be able to attend the meeting on monday . actually we will have to postpone the meeting to later in the week - on monday i got a doctor\\'s appointment that i cannot move unfortunately . i will send out a doodle poll later today to find a time that suits us all to catch up . this is actually very positive since i have a dentists appointment and was planning on attending but not saying anything , just typing . forgot to wish safe travels to harsha - some interesting conference ? please look at this: <https://swcarpentry . github . io/python-second-language/> - i don\\'t like so much the styling of that page but i very much like the structure of the teaching material - we can talk about it tomorrow . is the meeting going on somewhere , and i\\'m just in the wrong place , or did i misunderstand the time ? <@u060ffc15>: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/vburjwg26nc4nm7vlty3g6z6ree> here is the meeting and here are the live minutes <https://docs . google . com/document/d/12yeuwqwaswo04m4tq4maajhf9ysenomjqh-1jfoyzf4/edit> . thanks . hah , finally i have slack desktop so i don\\u2019t have to remember to open a tab whenever i restart my browser . <@u23htrtjt>: i just use pidgin and handle it like any other xmpp chat . i will have to look into a system to end all other systems but that\\u2019s meta-work and i need to focus on workwork in the immediate future . i also installed the desktop app for exactly the same reason - always forgot to open a tab for one of the many slacks . i have created a cheatsheet document in our google folder that contains all handy urls (also hangouts) since it is difficult to keep track of them . also we now have a redirect that brings you directly to the google drive: <http://tinyurl . com/coderefinery> . <@u2b3dh142> please have a look at the minutes in particular at the helsinki workshop planning - please add yourself there with your favorite topic(s) . i thought more about thor\\'s suggestion to have some buffer time in the morning and i think this is a good idea . small buffer in the morning to weed out software/hardware problems . jyry\\'s blueprints as fallback and more time to fix things at the end of day 1 . i just realized we totally forgot about style checking tools . will add it somewhere so it isn\\u2019t forgotten . good point - it could be close to ides but could also be close to testing . it\\u2019s kind of in two places . one is about keeping the repository clean (possibly by a git pre-commit hook) and the other is about getting hints about how not to write code to make clean commits easier . do all nordic countries use the same date format ? i . e . 1 . 12 . 2106 for the first of december ? i think there should be a university course on time representation in computers and it should be mandatory :stuck_out_tongue: . <@u0kv7fvnv> did you have a branching strategy in mind for the stuff-repo or is it ok to just push (without force) to master for now ? i am not sure about date format , to avoid confusion i prefer to use 2016-dec-01 or 2016-12-01 (since there are american students at nordic universities who will get confused otherwise) . good point , i need to protect master from forced pushes . i think everyone gets confused with iso dates unless they are computer scientists , in which case they fall in love . except east asians . so far no branching strategy , in doubt i recommend pr from forks , see also this: <http://blog . jasonmeridth . com/posts/do-not-issue-pull-requests-from-your-master-branch/> . for a very long time i did not know that filing prs from master was not a good idea . thanks for the changes ! <https://esipfed . github . io/software-assessment-guidelines/guidelines . html> . long document but has lots of good stuff in it . tomorrow (thu) i will show you the workshop announcement website , then we clean it up and we should announce it on monday (i figure it\\'s better than friday , then it\\'s more likely that people see it and that it does not get lost under the email pile from the weekend) . early on monday is a good time to announce stuff . on the other hand there is something to be said about triggering the procrastination reflex on friday afternoons . a few empoyers ago i worked with some partners who did spamming en masse and optimized the send times for click rates . unfortunately i no longer remember what the best times were . it would be super interesting to know the clickrate w . r . t . weak day . the click rates are abysmal in general and iirc peak in mails received at around 10 and 14 , i . e . the classical coffee break times . in the first workshop , should we add something related to git workflows . yes , this should be part of the git part 2 (second day) - do you want to talk about it ? we should def talk about branching strategies , discuss pros and cons . please add it to the monday meeting minutes program draft so that we don\\'t forget , thank you , i will use that to create a workshop page today . <@u0kv7fvnv> we need to agree on where basic git ends and advanced git starts but that\\u2019s not necessarily critical at this moment . i will be bit busy in december , so cannot promise anything at the moment . i agree with <@u23htrtjt> that we should agree about basic git and advanced git . probably in the next meeting . yes i agree , soon (next week) we will fine tune the schedule so that we can start preparing material . dear all , please check this draft: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2016-12-14-espoo/> - please criticize it , let\\'s make this page really crystal clear and attractive and let us discuss it here (harsha i have added you for the moment - we will see; also i am not sure about the cmake part - depends a bit on the audience , not interesting for python folks but very relevant for fortran people , perhaps the schedule is too full anyway) . the sources are hardcoded for the moment , later the data will move to yaml/md and we will have a generic workshop template to make them homogeneous and to avoid code duplication . please criticize both style and layout and content . thanks to jyry for the good checklist which i have used . i would like to announce it on monday together with the stockholm course which will use the same template . <@u0kv7fvnv> do you want the criticisms here or in a structured manner ? i think i\\u2019ll just make a pull request . pr is also good . any media is good . thanks ! the one thing that i won\\u2019t touch but want to say is that the term sustainable research software development suffers from an operator precedent issue . it could be (sustainable ((research software) development)) . but it could equally be e . g . (sustainable research) (software development) , which is confusing . thanks ! i will try to fix that . on a tangent the only book back legible from your bookshelf in video conferences is something about lisp :slightly_smiling_face: . probably you have thought about it , but just as a reminder i want to bring it up . recently , while discussing with physicists i came to know that people are still using cvs , because they are still comfortable with it . i think that with the increasing demand for open access and sharing the data , it is becoming a common practice to share everything in github (for verifying research results as well) . it is a good idea to discuss something about why people are moving towards git and github ? good idea , we should motivate open source and open data in our course , i will add it to our notes . i personally feel strongly about vagrant , docker or similar tools for setting up reproducible research environments . but i don\\u2019t have anything concrete to say about that . hmm ... these are important but i have personally little experience with it . i have added a new document for our meeting on monday to the drive , it contains the agenda points (so that i don\\'t forget) , feel free to add more agenda points that you would like to talk about; from now on we will always set the agenda before the meeting and then use this document as meeting minutes . please don\\'t forget to add yourself to the website - try it also locally so that you get jekyll working , this is how i installed it: <https://gist . github . com/bast/9f5c2843d3e9bc4744e7016b56d8fe8e> . it is really important that you get comfortable with jekyll since we will use it a lot for the material (i think) . no other comments to <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2016-12-14-espoo/> ? lots of topics for a 3-day workshop . maybe group them into larger themes . also a tentative agenda might be good , but potential participants could be interested in specific sessions only . what is the format of the workshop ? presentations with demos ? also hands-on sessions ? what about socializing in the evenings ? thanks ! good points - i will trim a bit the themes and be more descriptive about the format and add a tentative agenda . we definitely want to have one evening (evening day 2) where people can hang out and discuss code and life in general . sorry for late feedback on this . i think it looks very good , but do you think something should be added on the format on the workshop , i . e . that it\\u2019ll be very informal and interactive with type-along type of presentations ? thanks ! i have now hopefully implemented all suggestions: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2016-12-14-espoo/> . we will fine-tune the agenda tomorrow . do you use the words agenda and schedule interchangeably ? also i think we should talk about the psychology of coding (e . g . impostor syndrome) but i\\u2019m sure we can fit that into the other presentations for now . in the medium term though it\\u2019d be cool to have a separable unit of stuff related to that . i think i meant schedule :slightly_smiling_face: . i agree , for the moment we can absorb a \"slide\" or two somewhere but we can write up some blog post on it . hi , what do you think about having a linkedin profile for the project too ? i have thought about it - at the moment i am a bit afraid of the maintenance load , already busy enough with website and twitter . what i want to avoid is some social account which looks inactive because we are too busy - but if it is maintained by somebody else than me and actively maintained then i think it is a good idea :slightly_smiling_face: . i could do the maintenance and set up . if the content could be same/similar with tweeter\\'s own , and also to ping everyone on the team to like/share/whatever . agenda is more for meetings where you have definitive items to go through , so timeline or schedule would maybe be better words , i agree . submitted a linkedin company page creation request . thanks ! i am just worried that we will create something that will go stale; personally my main focus goes to the website and twitter but perhaps there are good use cases for distributing information via linkedin ? i will change \"agenda\" to \"schedule\" . are we in different hangout rooms ? hmm\\u2026 is there a hangout room or have i received an invite for one ? i used the same as last time , which seemd to work: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/vburjwg26nc4nm7vlty3g6z6ree> . on the trello board we have a cheatsheet to the right which contains all the various urls . the survey has the programming languages in more or less descending order of preference (because it coincides with the order the languages came to mind) . just a random observation :slightly_smiling_face: . good point , i need to randomize it a bit . reorged a bit but i kept a logical progression . for those who will teach in espoo in dec , please indicate your availability this week here: <http://doodle . com/poll/yrzb5f8ndwgt2n3h> - we will fine-tune the schedule so that everybody knows how much material they need to prepare . <@u23htrtjt> i suggest we two talk separately to delimit where the two git blocks start and end . please share these with your friends and contacts: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2016-12-14-espoo/> and <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-02-20-stockholm/> . should we keep track of the addresses/places where we have announced these courses ? <@u0kv7fvnv>: yes , please . alright - i will create a trello card for it where we will keep track of it . hi , just checking the workshop contents . for the future workshops , should we add something related to licenses , software complexity (basic software metrics) , code review tools and basic design patterns ? yes , i want to talk a bit about software complexity , we definitely should include licensing and code review tools , design patterns may be a bit abstract for \"innocent\" researchers . if you announce the course , please keep track of it somehow for the moment , during the day i will create a trello card for the workshop so that we keep track of things . also <@u23htrtjt> <@u2234ay5a> <@u21p57pkr> please let me know when we can talk about the schedule this week (either by the doodle above or here in the chat or somewhere) so that we can start creating material . and i don\\'t want to start a flame war but i have colleagues who say that if you need design patterns , then you are programming in the wrong language :slightly_smiling_face: i think they have actually a point . i agree that design patterns may be too much for the researchers . i think that using some suitable patterns will make the software evolution smoother . just to be clear i think that design patterns are extremely useful in the real world . regarding announcing the workshops . i\\u2019m thinking of mailing lists like those for the serc and essence e-science initiatives here in sweden . of course i can send to individual reserach groups also , but that would be very biased towards my own scientific field , which maybe isn\\u2019t fair in some sense ? a workaround would maybe be to ask all application experts here at pdc to announce it to their contacts . that would cover theoretical chemistry , materials physics , bioinformatics and computational fluid dynamics , which is still not exhaustive and would leave many major research groups out . i\\u2019m just mentioning this in case you have any opinions . yes , we should announce to serc and essence mailing list , in your case probably also on pdc website - i think it is ok to also announce to your friends and colleagues in addition to the wide mailing lists . personally i would and will send this info also to my contacts directly because my feeling is that the big lists are not very effective at reaching people . in the past courses we have seen the biggest surges in registrations when sending it out to groups and not to big lists . but we have to make sure that the info is visible so that everybody at least in principle has the chance to attend . i will also send the info to past participants of the sese courses so that they can tell their friends about it since they know how the course looks like . if we have the problem that too many people want to attend , that is a good problem - empty room would be worse . but i agree that we need to be careful not to bias . <@u21ph491q> we now announce that registration for stockholm workshop will open nov 21 - is this ok ? should it be earlier or later ? my reasoning for that date is that if we see problems with helsinki registration , we can learn from it and adapt . i think nov 21 is fine , but it\\u2019s quite early isn\\u2019t it ? most other events at pdc are announced with shorter registration periods . but i see no harm in announcing early of course . i agree that it is on the early side - should we move it to dec ? we could open it a week before helsinki course , then the helsinki registration is closed and we know what the issues were . some news: only way to pr on linkedin is to have a same domain (@coderefinery . org) email address . what is pr in this context ? <mailto:info@coderefinery . org|info@coderefinery . org> forwards to my gmail address currently . by pr i mean advertising of upcoming events in the first place . well , btw , this info@coderef ... might be enough :slightly_smiling_face: i\\'ll try again then] . <https://gyazo . com/a445e7f887cb1ca8a0e38d4d490d3116> . if you could send over the mail ... forwarded ... thnx . is the black-fonted image our official logo ? twitter/github . it\\'s a temporary logo , a new logo is in the pipeline , i will show you drafts asap . <https://www . linkedin . com/company/10953141 ? trk=vsrp_companies_res_name&amp;trkinfo=vsrpsearchid%3a1453437891476281267996%2cvsrptargetid%3a10953141%2cvsrpcmpt%3aprimary> . pls follow) . thanks ! only thing that is a bit strange is that we look there like a company which we are not ... can i use it already ? an update later ... yes . <@u0kv7fvnv> , sure let\\u2019s move the announcement of the stockholm workshop to a week before the helsinki workshop . ready to publish the workshop in csc calendar . <@u0kv7fvnv> do you already have google analytics (or similar) in place ? thanks jyry ! i am tracking clicks via bitly but no analytics in place yet . (on twitter) . ok . published the page but it\\u2019s not visible in the calendar yet . thanks jyry ! i will very soon set up some place where we track where we have announced it so please remember until then :slightly_smiling_face: . i will and i sent a request asking what i did wrong because it\\u2019s not visible in the calendar . hah , finally course is also visible here <https://www . csc . fi/web/training> . <@u23htrtjt> thank you ! i am sorry that i have silently moved the registration start to oct 20 (because i am running out of time with setting up registration form) - can you please ask them to update it on <https://www . csc . fi/web/training/-/coderefinery-workshop-in-espoo-2016> - sorry for this extra work . sure , np . small changes are easy . understanding the logic of the large system is not . thank you . changed . i hope it was only present once there . thanks . i am just testing the registration tech using <https://www . typeform . com> , <https://zapier . com> , <http://mailchimp . com> , and gmail and google spreadsheet: people will register , get a confirmation email , i get a confirmation email , they get automatically filled into a google spreadsheet and get automatically added to a mailing list which i can use for practical info and followup . amazing combo - please reserve few minutes tomorrow to test the registration form which i will share with you tomorrow . dear all , please test-register here: <http://bast . fr/coderefinery . org/workshops/2016-12-14-espoo/> - please report everything that is strange or surprising or sub-optimal; it should automatically email you after you have registered (can take up to 5 minutes after registration) . that was the coolest registration form i\\u2019ve ever used ! really nice . i didn\\u2019t notice anything weird . how did you accomplish the list of scientific disciplines ? ah i see now the discussion in <#c050v61rb|general> , it\\u2019s from scb . thanks for testing ! looks also good so far on my side . you got automatically put into a spreadsheet and also automatically added to a mailing list (don\\'t worry , no spam ahead) - the mailing list is to send out follow-ups and practical info to participants . i got some comments from pinja for changes in the form and mail which i will implement today . tomorrow i will open the csc registration . <@u0kv7fvnv>: haha , that was fun . hope my email adress works , i hate registrations when + doesn\\'t work in email adresses . at least i got the automatic email . <@u0kv7fvnv>: but you should decide which is your primary official contact email , the email is from your gmail adress , but with a reply to the uit one . yes for technical (financial) reasons i send the confirmation emails from my gmail . i cannot make it from my uit address without either paying or involving other people , i think it is acceptable . <@u0kv7fvnv> , in csc calendar it was mentioned that price can be found in workshop website , but i didn\\u2019t notice any price information on the website . ok thanks ! the course is free . it would be nice to have a nominal fee but i don\\'t want to deal with the bureaucracy attached to a nominal fee so it will be free . i will add info . some followup from last meeting (not everybody was there therefore short background): we have tentatively decided to replace profiling and debugging by jupyter , see tentative schedule here: <http://bast . fr/coderefinery . org/workshops/2016-12-14-espoo/> . reasoning is that it ties more nicely with the rest and there are dedicated courses on debugging and profiling . <@u2234ay5a> will it upset your planning ? <@u21ph491q> have you thought about whether you would like to give it ? you would get feedback from us until then and we could test it at our kick-off (more info on that soon) . i am about to write some guidelines on how to develop material and a course . <@u0kv7fvnv> sure i\\'ll give the jupyter session ! . i think this would be good because then you can be in charge of that which does not mean that you will do all the work , you will get contributions for us but i think it makes sense if the same person prepares the material for csc and kth courses - don\\'t worry we will help you with that . here some thoughts: <https://github . com/coderefinery/course-maintenance/blob/master/material-preparation-guide . md> (later we can move it to the website or to readthedocs) . <@u0kv7fvnv> nono , i\\'ll be fine :slightly_smiling_face: . super ! lot of good stuff here: <http://programminghistorian . org/lessons/> . we have the very first registration for the espoo course . hooray ! <@u2b3dh142> or <@u23htrtjt> have you got more info from jussi or others about email announcements \"finland\"-wide or at least helsinki-wide ? haven\\u2019t asked . can you two please coordinate this and make sure the info gets out ? i got a list of suggestions on how to market but haven\\u2019t had the time to act on any of them . there is a wide distribution newsletter going out later this month and we should be on that . but then there is social media marketing and directly contacting certain coordinators in nearby universities . great - let me know if i can do something to get it out . if you have such contacts , then i will happily bug them . we need to avoid two situations: info not getting out and multiple people bugging the same person . i don\\u2019t have and i\\u2019m pretty sure my contact in the pr department heta wants to guard her contacts . so i\\u2019ll work with her on what and how to communicate to the coordinators and probably let her do the tweeting entirely . thank you very much . i tried to contact jussi , but he seems to be away . i\\u2019ve sent him an email about newsletter thing and other appropriate channels to contact . i am planning to send to one doctoral coordinator i know personally . do you have any recommendations in sending am email or it should be just free-form ? i completely trust your judgment so free form is perfectly fine - just please coordinate this a bit with jyry (you probably do) . sure ! i know heta is around because i saw her in boxing this morning . do you think she will still be at office ? i have cleaned up a bit the checklist: <https://github . com/coderefinery/course-maintenance/blob/master/workshop-checklist . md> . i will make a trello board/card out of it and there we can also track where this was announced . currently , we haven\\u2019t set any deadline for registering right . that\\'s right , my hope is that enough people register and then we will close as soon as it is full (plus some oversubsciption) . do you think it will help to have a closing date to motivate people to decide and register ? i was just checking csc\\u2019s newsletter and there we always have registration deadline . don\\u2019t know if it is absolutely necessary or not . have you written this purposefully in the website page: \"the aim of this course is to *demonstrate to and familiarize* the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research software development\" . is it just *demonstrate and familiarize* . it might not have been me but i think the reasoning was \"demonstrate to\" and \"familiarize with\" - feel free to change though . i have created cards for our workshops where we track things based on the checklist: <https://trello . com/b/pcmcznwl/coderefinery-workshops> . please document there where this workshop has been announced (or suggest a better place) . i also like jyry\\'s idea about defining a course lead - i can default to be the course lead for our first two workshops but if somebody wants to take that role and get free beer from me and good karma , that is most welcome . since we are still learning and debugging things the course lead would get a lot of help from me until we have streamlined the routines . the main role of the course lead is to kick our butts so that we stay on track and delegate as much as possible . apparently she\\u2019s not at the office today and the email system is down . hm ! i lost some weight ! can you create an issue for it on github ? <@u0kv7fvnv> i don\\'t think you\\'ve got the issue , but i accidentally invented a completely new diet this week: you take a steaming hot soup , fill it into a big cup (keeps the heat better) and quickly suck it up through a drinking straw . your tongue will be so burned you won\\'t be able to eat any warm food for the next three days , meaning you\\'ll live only on fruits and vegetables . sorry to hear that ! i prefer the css diet .... to everyone: i wrote a draft for the second pdc newsletter for 2016 about coderefinery . it would be great to get feedback and improvements on the text , so following radovan\\'s suggestion i created a directory \"outreach\" in our google drive and placed a google document there containing the draft . feel free to edit it directly or write comments . i should send a final version to our dissemination person at pdc on oct 30 . thanks thor ! i will comment on it very soon . the motivation to share the document was that it will make it easier to recycle good texts for various pr activities . yeah that\\'s a very good point of course , cheers . <@u21ph491q>: great text , don\\'t find anything to comment on . maybe it needs a picture (we still have no logo , right ? ) and a reference to thor as a person , so people don\\'t forget about it immediately . . no we still don\\'t have a logo , i am now working on project plan , this weekend will write the talk for tuesday (i will also share the talk sources for future reuse) . i did borrow a few catchy phrases from radovan\\'s proposal , as you may see :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u0kv7fvnv> that\\'s fine right ? absolutely fine . just a reminder that tomorrow (monday) our weekly meeting is cancelled and we see each other on monday oct 31 . csc team: this week we need to start a massive propaganda operation . currently we have 1 subscriber to the course and we could find ourselves in front of an empty room if we don\\'t let people know about it . and very wide email announcements might not help us (although we want to get on them as well) . we need targeted emails . good contacts are groups who develop code and have small or medium allocations on csc services . another good group of contacts are people organizing software carpentry workshops in helsinki . it is priority number one for this week that we let the community know . please let me know if you are able to get and use such contact information - thank you . by able to use i meant allowed to use . slides for snic user forum on tuesday: <http://bit . ly/snic-2016|bit . ly/snic-2016> (sources: <https://github . com/coderefinery/talk-intro/tree/snic-2016>) - suggestions/comments most welcome; slide style will probably be adapted to more neic branding . <@u0kv7fvnv> coderefinery should be mentioned in a wide distribution csc training newsletter some time this week and there should be a tweet and an email to a relevant specialized mailing list (assumed to take place before or at the same time with the newsletter) . <@u21ph491q>: the map picture with the different cities (slide 19 in radovans snic uf talk) could be something for the pdc newsletter as well . . thanks <@u23htrtjt> . the map is missing tromso :slightly_smiling_face: and perhaps iceland . had a hallway chat with our communications person . she suggested a slogan along the lines of \\u201cless tinkering , more research\\u201d . the verb in finnish was perhaps a bit more nuanced but we can iterate on that . i like the basic idea though . yes the idea is very good - it is useful to have a slogan that people can relate to . many people will not know what neic is and most people will not know what coderefinery is . i updated the pdc newsletter article according to radovan\\u2019s comment . may still not be optimal , but i\\u2019ll send it to the pdc scientific writer now for language and style improvement . comments are still welcomed . i contacted a physics professor i know at aalto university (tapio ala-nissila) to ask him to forward information to his group and co-workers , but he told me that the timing is unfortunate since he\\u2019s bringing over the physics nobel laureates to helsinki for a large event on dec 15 that will attract lots of physicists (many of which belong to our intended audience) . so that\\u2019s a bit unfortunate . that is a pity - thanks for contacting him - we need these direct contacts . related or unrelated we have now registration number 2 :slightly_smiling_face: . email campaign at csc seems to have an effect - we now have 4 registrations . 9 registrations - thanks for getting the info out , it seems to work very nicely . heta asked me for a blog post . i\\u2019ll try to draft something up . do you want to proofread before i send it to her for sparklification ? i trust your judgement without me proofreading but if you want me to give comments i will be happy to . i have an idea of a provocative but positive spin on things . ha - i like provocative , let me have a look - not to control but to possibly give more input . sure , but now to the circus (literally) . :slightly_smiling_face: . on the contracting i got some more info from the deic meeting today: (12:44:21) paalpett: <@u0a9nv7px>: just spoke to lene at deic meeting . determening who will be our service contract counterpart is dragging out . could be up to a month before they know . ok thanks . i got contacted by heikki lehvaslaiho who would like to be a helper at the csc workshop ! i think that is great - any objections ? that sounds good , the more the merrier . i think it is really cool - i have added him to the website: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2016-12-14-espoo/> . ping . :slightly_smiling_face: . ? seems that i\\'ve confused the times) . we are starting in 15 minutes , aren\\'t we ? nikolaid : according my calendar , yes . yes , in 3 mins . we meet here: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/sn7rt3wmgvcxhn363xj3owg4iue> . <@u21ph491q> i will open the registration for the stockholm course later today or tomorrow and inform you afterwards . 18 registrations for csc course - i will share data with you this week . sounds good , i can start announcing tomorrow then . thanks again to csc team for great job at announcing - i was really worried for some time that we would not fill the room but i was proven wrong and i am very grateful for your good job ! we have 24 registrations for the csc course , i will overbook it with 2 and then close the registration . i have added a document to our google drive into the folder \"workshops\" which contains answers to our pre-course survey and also answers to the question on what people expect to get from this course . please consult . i have closed the registration - we have 26 people . interesting answers to the survey ! seems that we\\u2019ll have a few from the humanities as well , which is great . regarding the build tools question , we should probably have split up the \\u201cnone or not applicable\\u201d option into \\u201cnone but i want to learn\\u201d and \\u201cnot applicable in my project\\u201d , since maybe it\\u2019s difficult to tell now whether it\\u2019s motivated to include a cmake session . i will actually reopen the reg for 2 more: one was duplicate and one person can only attend one day . good point about the survey question: i will note it for the registrations after stockholm (don\\'t want to change a running db) . actually thor can i ask you to change it here directly: <https://github . com/coderefinery/course-maintenance/blob/master/pre-course-survey . md> . sure . done . i . e i made a pr . <@u2l0js68k>: welcome to the team now also officially ! :-) hope you can make it to the kick-off ! thank you very much :slightly_smiling_face: i will try to figure everything out tomorrow so hopefully i will be able to meet everyone during the kick-off . <@u21ph491q> thanks for announcing - already 2 registrations in . great . i actually have a feeling that a lot more people will want to attend (after the full advertising machinery starts) than there are available places . by the way , <@u0kv7fvnv> , let me know if i can assist with the kickoff meeting . i am almost sure this will be the case - it was the case last two times but that is a good problem then . help with the kick-off is most welcome; i have created a folder \"kick-off\" in the google drive that holds some loose ends . it would be good to get input on the program and ideas for what to do in the evening (like you suggested via mail) - what i want to avoid is a \"boring\" meeting where 1 person speaks and the rest listens , ideally i would like us to have lots of interaction where we bounce ideas off each other constantly . i just realized that i can come to sk\\xe5vsj\\xf6holm by car , and i could even pick some people up at the airport . that might make sense if there are some mismatches in arrival times (e . g . someone arriving hours later than most others) or if everyone doesn\\u2019t fit into a big taxi . thanks ! this is helpful - once we know all arrival times we will optimize the transport , thanks for the offer . shouldn\\u2019t we plan to do some activity at the kickoff meeting ? the conference venue has this to say: \"we would like to claim that we are in fact experts in conference activities . well no not really \\u2013 we are experts at matching groups , budget and occasion with the right activity . \" . maybe everyone here can go to <http://www . skavsjoholm . se/en/activities/> and pick a few winter activities , and then we compare everyone\\u2019s choices and select the most popular one . ideally this should happen in the evening because we need the afternoon for work and it also depends on the price - thor do you know how much these things cost ? yes of course , it should be in the evening , except perhaps if it\\'s a short activity the morning after ? but let\\u2019s first look at the evening options . the cost will vary a lot depending on the activity . they say that can recommend or customize an activity depending on the group\\u2019s wishes . including the price . unfortunately i don\\'t know our price envelope for this - <@u0a9nv7px> ? i will communicate our activity price margins asap . to csc team: can you recommend a good accommodation close to the csc offices ? how easy or difficult is it to reach csc if i have accommodation in central helsinki ? <https://dev . to/yelluw/how-bad-software-gets-made> . <@u0kv7fvnv>: i enjoyed sato hotelhome: <http://www . satohotellikoti . fi/en/our-service/> . 25 min on foot to csc . <@u0kv7fvnv>: have you seen this: <https://www . csc . fi/how-to-reach-us> . thank you ! <@u0kv7fvnv>: the closest hotel is <https://www . radissonblu . com/en/hotel-espoo> , ~10 min by foot . (but i have no experience of it , so i have no idea how good or bad it\\'s otherwise) . thanks ! i was there before and it was good , we even had smaller workshops there . <@u0kv7fvnv> , have you booked flights to helsinki ? when are you arriving and departing ? hi all , i preliminarily booked an activity for the kick-off meeting . it\\u2019s appropriately called \\u201cthe code\\u201d and takes 45 minutes and costs around 4500 sek . i booked it at 18:30 , thinking that we might have dinner at 19:30 . the lady i spoke to also offered to book the boule court for us without cost (normally it costs 1500 sek) , so i booked it at 20:30 for one hour . obviously we can change the booking or cancel it , if we prefer to work longer or just have beer and relax . who are the personnel in coderefinery ? is there an url that i can point to ? is this up to date ? <http://coderefinery . org/team/> . this is the right link , but it\\u2019s not completely up to date since new members joined recently . is this channel membership representative ? haha no 23 members . do you need an updated list now ? i can give you the current list of members , to the best of my knowledge . sure , am presently in a meeting where the question came up . apart from the members on the website , we have: lukasz bartosz berger from dtu , bj\\xf8rn lindi (trondheim) and sabry razick (oslo) . thank you ! thanks thor for arranging the activity ! i was offline for 3 days - i have booked my flights to helsinki to arrive dec 12 evening and depart dec 17 morning . i will arrive one day earlier so that i can react on site if there are issues . i haven\\'t booked accommodation yet and it would perhaps make sense if you (thor) and i reserve the same accommodation . we have 7 registrations for stockholm workshop . 16 registrations for stockholm workshop . wow ! that was quick . i did ask two contact persons to forward an announcement to serc and essence , that must be it . yes it really worked - thank you for that ! 20 registrations - wow . did we decide how many registrations we would take for the stockholm event ? the room can take 38 , but i think we discussed a lower number as maximum . good point , i was for some reason aiming at 24 - it is important that we can move around and that the room is not packed , we are then also possibly 3-4 instructors/helpers in the room . what do you think about 30 ? or is it then too packed with 34 people in the room ? 26 ? <@u21ph491q> we have now 24 - i want to oversubscribe by at least 2 before closing it - what is in your opinion a sensible limit keeping in mind that 4 more persons are in the room . no i don\\u2019t think the room would be too packed with 34 people in total , it\\u2019s quite spacious . ok - thanks , i will let 32 people register and then close and keep waiting list for those who write me directly , there are always at least 2 people who cancel . i will note the limit on the trello card because the halftime of my memory is spectacular . ok that sounds good . hi , do we have a meeting today ? yes , meeting today at 12:00 cet , 13:00 eet - i will create an agenda document (on the google drive in \"minutes\" folder) in the next half an hour - i will share hangouts link here shortly before the meeting . we meet at the end of this hour here: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/sn7rt3wmgvcxhn363xj3owg4iue> . is there a simple way for me to check the survey answers for the helsinki course ? <https://speakerdeck . com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans> i liked this but i figure the people coming to the course might be a bit too technical for that . survey answers: <https://radovan . typeform . com/report/j2logt/ze6b> . over half already use git . well , i suppose the choir needs to attend church services as well . my experience from teaching git is that if we do it well then everybody will learn something new , also people who know it already - actually also teachers :slightly_smiling_face: . now there are 34 applicants and 7 cancellations at the course later this week . the reserve slot holders are relatively unlikely to come as they may already have made other arrangements . there are 26 slots in the computer room . so perhaps even more people in the queue . ok . while filling out forms for the kick-off meeting i am asked to provide known allergies in addition to dietary preferences , please let me know just in case via direct message or email . hey , could you please \"like\" the recent news update for our project: <https://www . linkedin . com/company/coderefinery ? trk=top_nav_home> . we had a discussion with nikolaid about an example python library to demonstrate various practices . a long , long time ago i did this for a similar purpose <https://github . com/jyrsa/surpriser> . i\\'d probably change most technologies used but the idea is still the same . thanks for inspiration - i will work on it this week - i think we will need to simplify so that even people who never used python can follow; i suggest that we use examples in our materials that we currently like best . next week we will realize that they don\\'t always fit but then we discuss and decide how to homogenize them . for the python library i think it should be only functions (like in your example) which perhaps do simple operations on text (because that is relatively easy to grasp) - based on that we demo travis and also coverage analysis . i also discovered git books . <https://www . gitbook . com/> . thought that might be an interesting introduction to git without the coding . i saw it but have never tried it myself yet - possibly this is a good approach . it\\'s really good if we introduce git on something that everybody can grasp and where versions make sense - another example that i saw once and liked was to develop a guacamole recipe using git . i think that would require irl testing . <@u0kv7fvnv> i was in an interesting meeting about csc using gitlab and possibly offering it as a service in the future . currently we just have a recognized need but no funding . there might be synergy benefits if we could create our internal gitlab and and the one for coderefinery at the same time . <@u2b3dh142> if you\\'re vested in this i can forward the calendar invite . that sounds very good ! please bring ideas to our git hosting discussion at kick-off , i would like us to start with the git repo already very early in 2017 . <@u23htrtjt> yes ! please forward me the invitation . hi everybody - we have the possibility to give a 2h tutorial to the neic crowd at the all hands meeting (last day): <http://ahm17 . neic . nordforsk . org/schedule/> - one idea that came up would be to give a \"best of\" show from coderefinery , perhaps git , perhaps git and travis , hands-on , condensed to two hours . we could reuse material that we have . does this sound interesting ? would somebody volunteer do deliver such a tutorial with my help ? this could also be a field test for our neic 2017 conference tutorial . sorry i was wrong: not last day but third day , and 1 . 5 h tutorial . we will talk about it tomorrow at kick-off , i have put it on the schedule . sorry for the silence on this one , yeah let\\u2019s discuss the neic tutorial tomorrow . <@u0kv7fvnv> you said you wanted to mention functional programming <https://github . com/wavebitscientific/functional-fortran> . (not sure if that\\'s a joke or not) . whoo-hoo looks interesting ! back in office , dear everybody , thanks for very good meeting and tons of questions and good ideas , exactly as i was hoping for . <@u2l0js68k> i think we should slowly start to scout for a good date range and room for a cph workshop in may: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/> (it was marked as march on the website until now but in the project plan i have planned may to give us some air after the stockholm workshop) . kudos to <@u0kv7fvnv> and the coderefinery team for a very engaged and energizing kick off meeting ! i was very impressed by seeing such a \"new\" group working highly foucused on a shared common purpose from day one (actually , minute one) . it was very nice to meet everyone ! thanks for a good meeting . <https://twitter . com/coderefine/status/801824523783958528> . .. and i missed it , i was so looking forward to the kick-off ! . <@u0kv7fvnv>: nice sunlight btw ! really gorgeous pic . yes i produced some vitamin d during the last two days - up here the sun is gone until end of jan . hey , could you please like &amp; share if possible: <https://www . linkedin . com/company/10953141 ? trk=tyah&amp;trkinfo=clickedvertical%3acompany%2centitytype%3aentityhistoryname%2cclickedentityid%3acompany_10953141%2cidx%3a0> . btw , i was wondering if coderef could get to this page too somehow: <https://neic . nordforsk . org/training/> ? we are there: <https://neic . nordforsk . org/training/upcoming/> . <@u0kv7fvnv> are you going to make tweaks on the example-lesson or is it ok to create new repos from it ? it\\'s ok to take it as starting point - we may want to tweak later but this will not affect the material , in other words you will not get extra work by me making changes to the layout - i will be able to tweak this even alone . i will later implement some solution which minimizes code duplication . have you thought about how to visualize git logs ? the markdown files and the html files should be rather orthogonal . will you use your gitink ? i will personally use \"my\" approach i have used before but i don\\'t force it on you . which was gitink ? yes , what i like about it is that the output is lightweight (svg) . i don\\'t particularly mind using it assuming that it doesn\\'t fall apart on me . have you considered packaging it and putting it on pypi ? it could be a bit brittle , but then we can improve it . i would like it to be on pypi eventually . i would like it to be on pypi for nice(ish) build set-up for generating the images for a lesson . use these as inspiration: <https://github . com/coderefinery/lessons/tree/master/img/git/branches> . but one great thing about pip is that it will install almost anything from github as well . i want to first clean it up a bit before putting it out on pypi , it has been created in a rush (what hasn\\'t ? ) . there seems to be an unfortunate css precedence conflict between rouge and bootstrap . had to disable rouge or the code would have been the same color as the background . we really need rouge highlighting - is this not something that can be resolved ? feel also free to modify <https://github . com/coderefinery/example-lesson/blob/gh-pages/assets/css/rouge . css> . ... or pygment (but jekyll likes rouge) . we also need the example that will walk us through the course . i think the surpriser is too complex . one idea (nikolai) was to write a super simple script which computes percentages (or similar) of python knowledge based on our (anonymized) data - i like it and haven\\'t come up with anything better . supriser is a a nice example but might be too complex to explain and get for python newbies . i am still brainstorming though ... i kinda like the idea of reading simple data (csv ? ) , do something super simple with it (compute avg or similar) and print it . i am still traveling until tomorrow but on thursday i start heavily pushing my material . i was thinking that we\\'d start with a simple hello world and step by step take it in the direction of the surpriser . but a csv might also be doable . and again , if we just import pandas then we can do crazy cool things in 2-3 rows as long as people don\\'t need to understand all the concepts behind the rows . i think pandas is doable if we keep it super simple . did we have a volunteer for creating a course certificate template ? i will create the first version end of this week . ok . (i will recycle sources from previous workshops) . have you thought about having the challenge-functionality from swcarpentry lessons ? it seems like a good idea to include exercises . can you post a link to it ? we definitely want exercises - exercises are good , it reconnects the audience . i\\'ve reserved meeting rooms in csc for monday 11 . 12 and tuesday 12 . 12 , which we can use for preparations . for monday the room is diskurssi (next to the training room) and for tuesday sensori on 7th floor . most of the visitor meeting rooms were already taken . still a bit of a work in progress but i hacked the challenge css and js from swcarpentry because i like the idea of presenting user-exercises in that format <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-intro/01-basics/#challenge-example> . thanks ! the challenges are cool - we need to make sure we attribute the code and inspirations . i have tried to do it here: <https://github . com/coderefinery/example-lesson/blob/gh-pages/readme . md> - we also need to make that visible on the website . are we planning to have a git repository , where all the participants would be given write access before the training ? github methinks . no i don\\'t think so , we will practice contributions but through fork-pr , in other words without write access . but we should practice creating own repos and pushing to them . if there is good motivation to have such a repo , then we can do it . jyry in your intro part you introduce github right ? (without going too much into distributed and multiple remotes) - i am asking this because we will do the doc lesson in the afternoon on github . yeah , i was going to have pushing the created repository to github as the final step . perfect . install instructions: <https://coderefinery . github . io/installation/> (sources: <https://github . com/coderefinery/installation>) - please document your requirements and how to install them . please ask me if it is not clear how that site is set up - don\\'t mind the looks so much , we will improve them as we go . but feel free to improve the site since some of you are black-belt web gurus . hi all , shall we recommend miniconda as the main installation of python ? it would align well with the installation of jupyter , which is most safely installed via anaconda . i\\'m more of a pip man myself if you\\'re asking for opinions . ok , so install python via pip and jupyter via miniconda ? we would then switched pythons when moving into the jupyter session . or jupyter via miniconda , but it feels like it\\u2019s good to recommend the most failsafe option for jupyter . *jupyter via pip* i meant to write . for newbies anaconda is probably the simplest . for more experienced people we can recommend miniconda or venv . in the install instructions we can \"package\" all python things we need together (such as jupyter , sphinx , etc . ) . newbies especially those on windows will be overwhelmed with venv or pip imo . it is important that we all stick to one python version . we should also (briefly) document the fallback option that we have (local computers) - previously i used <https://c9 . io> as fallback but that one is out since now they require credit card info when you register for the free plan which for me disqualifies them . so should we as a main recommendation document anaconda installation , but as 2nd-3rd options mention miniconda and venv ? but miniconda is as simple as anaconda really , if one anyways needs to install extra packages outside of the anaconda core . and much more light-weight . i agree with you , i personally fear the bloat of anaconda - let\\'s go for 1 . anaconda/miniconda and 2 . venv . 3 . system-wide pip install (least good option) . ok , i\\u2019ll write that documentation then . thanks ! you can mention somewhere that for 1) and 2) no administrator password is needed (some people try sudo for everything and then mess up their system) . dear coderefinery team , please test and improve this: <https://coderefinery . github . io/installation/> - for those who will teach next week , please make sure that the tools you need are at least mentioned now so that others can work on the installation instructions - by the end of this week the instructions have to be complete and debugged otherwise we will face a lot of confusion at the workshop . i have a question , i\\u2019ve read that using compilers with python on windows , e . g . in cython , is tricky to set up . does anyone have experience ? i was planning to show a little cython and it would be a shame if windows users couldn\\u2019t try it . sorry i have personally almost zero experience on windows - but good idea to show cython on the notebook . i got a bit delayed with my material but i am now starting to dump sources to my repos and will clean them up over the next few days . for cython and windows i would search for cython and appveyor on github , there seems to be a lot out there . i am thinking to put all the generic jekyll stuff (branding , code highlighting , license , liquid templating) into a git submodule - it seems that github pages automatically clone into submodules - we would avoid code repetition and divergence (between different lesson repos) , does anything speak against such a strategy ? am i missing something ? i do that here (see jekyll-common): <https://github . com/coderefinery/documentation> . yeah - for the moment i go for submodules , also in example-lesson - let me know if you have questions or objections . thanks for the input radovan . i have the same problem , practically zero windows experience since the nineties ... and your strategy sounds good , but i don\\u2019t know that much about this (yet ! ) . what i have done is to put most of the common , material-independent sources to the jekyll-common repo , this is referenced via a git submodule . a git submodule is basically a directory path which points to another repository . with this propagating styling and generic changes between lessons becomes relatively straightforward . i have added doc on how to add the submodule in the example-lesson . after full day of work on documentation and cmake , i can see now that the new structure (exercise-driven , portioned into episodes) is useful for me at least - i have realized how not very useful my previous material was - still a long way to go but one week is a lot of time , tomorrow i work on testing and git parts . good to hear . i\\u2019ve been tying up loose ends with my material and extending it a bit , and trying hard to get in as many exercises as possible . for this first course occasion i find it really difficult to estimate time for different parts and the exercises , but presenting it once will make it much easier next time . on revision control , have you thought of comparing it to snapshoting in file systems or transaction management in rdbmses ? instead of using the term \"archive\" , i would simply use \"backup\" (slide 7 of intro to vc/git) . sorry for strolling around , same slide deck: is slide 9 (phd comics) really about collaboration ? to me it is more about (ab)using a specific file attribute (its name) for capturing version information ... (that\\'s probably bad practice and using vc could be good practice) . ouch \"written by linus torvalds\" (slide 15) ... pretty \"scientific\" argument :wink: . *$ git config --global core . editor \"vim\"* everything is forgiven :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: . do you want someone (not necessarily me) \"reviewing\" your slide deck(s) ? <@u0kv7fvnv> i\\'ll try to hash out an outline for the first git part tomorrow morning so you can have a better idea of what and where the handover is . <@u23htrtjt> cool ! i will also today start on revamping the more advanced git part , this will also help you to synchronize . <@u052rl9cu> thanks ! (i am a vi person myself :slightly_smiling_face: we are currently reworking the material going away from pure slides to more interactive and exercise-driven software carpentry style - comments are most welcome but the new material (at least my parts) will probably not be presentable before the end of the week . and the new material is not yet linked on the website - we will do so next week . <@u23htrtjt> i am now revamping <https://github . com/bast/gitink> a bit since i will heavily use it in my section - in case you have changes in mind , let\\'s coordinate to avoid conflicts (i just made it to run on py 3) . i will also add a bit more doc to it . wow what a horrorshow that code is :slightly_smiling_face: . reminder: tomorrow we meet on hangouts , please consult the agenda in the \"meetings\" folder - i will share the hangouts link here minutes before the meeting . so meeting in 10 ? or am i off by an hour ? yes , meeting in 9 , here: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/sn7rt3wmgvcxhn363xj3owg4iue> . can\\'t attend today; in another meeting . ok . ok i am not allowed to join the meeting \"the video call ended because of an error\" - i will restart my comp . so here\\'s some thoughts i had about the end state of creating a python project <https://github . com/coderefinery/csvwrangler> . it has: structure , code isolation , tests (including style) , some docstrings . the actual things that it does for can be changed if you\\'d like . sure we could do the same or similar in pandas , but to use pandas requires a lot of understanding about data frames and other pandas-like concepts that aren\\'t really the number one priority in the lesson(s) . thanks ! cool approach . i actually just wrote this: <https://github . com/bast/data-example> . ahh , you went the pandas way , which i agree is much better for jupyter and similar interactive approaches . also i did not know that one could pip install directly from github , great . we don\\'t have to use pandas , i understand your concern . that\\'s why i\\'ll be making a pull request to git-ink shortly with a setup . py . :slightly_smiling_face: i am so ashamed of my gitink code , i wrote it when i did not know how to do it better . so i can just use that to install gitink in virtualenvs straight from github . how about we combine your code with my data <https://github . com/bast/data-example/blob/master/data . csv> , simplify the code a bit - we can then introduce pandas at jupyter notebook stage . also we could add functions that do other types of aggregation than just mean or median so we could summarize the other fields as well . i think your idea for the code is good - we should only simplify it a bit so that even complete python beginners can follow - i like also the comments that more efficient implementations exist . it has to be understandable by somebody who sees python for the first time in their lives . my thinking was that we\\'d start building that step by step . maybe implement a simple python script and then start splitting functionality into smaller parts and testing parts . i gave the data more descriptive fields now . very good , i agree . in baby steps . <https://github . com/coderefinery/csvwrangler/tree/step1> start from something like that . which , while cryptic is a mere 16 lines of code so it shouldn\\'t overwhelm . <@u21ph491q> <@u0kv7fvnv> what companies do you want to represent in your badges ? kth and and neic respectively ? i guess mine should have both kth and neic , if possible . everyone else has only one . just pick one , i don\\'t think people will notice either way :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u21ph491q> i was asked to send fixes by end of business today so i\\'ll put you down as kth unless you object in the next 5 minutes . okay , kth it is ! neic for me . about the example: i did not go for the bike data in toronto because it was too many lines and it is not clear what it is just by looking at the data , that\\'s why i went for the favourite ice cream etc . why the from __future__ import print_function ? and i would start with having the main function code in the main scope , what you wrote is of course good practice but i think we should not start out with __name__ , we can arrive there later in the code complexity part . <@u2k0egsc8> i was thinking more about the neic 2017 workshop and the mixed martial arts idea - this would indeed be something new and fresh: showing good practices in mixed language and modular development , hands-on developing a fortran library , calling it from c and vice versa and testing it with python on travis - it would be some work to develop the material we would arrive at a very useful material which we can then reuse in other workshops , also it would be a workshop format which does not yet exist in abundance - i think i like the idea . the motivation for this is that there is a lot of legacy code written in a language which is good at x but bad at y and by combining languages one can leverage functionality . i have experimented with this here: <https://github . com/bast/context-api-example> , also see this: <https://scisoft . github . io/mma/> . if we go for it then i would need to decide whether we do this hands-on (personally i would prefer this , pedagogically more useful but harder to pull off) or lectures . this lesson is now slowly getting in shape: <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-collaborative/> - issues and prs very welcome . completely forgot: <@u2l0js68k> <@u2k0egsc8> <@u2k0z6mdg> please add yourself to this page: <http://coderefinery . org/team/> - please ask if it is not clear how (use git grep) . <https://red-badger . com/blog/2016/11/29/gitgithub-in-plain-english> . <@u0kv7fvnv> mma is a very much tailoring . if you just do lecturing it has limited value . i vote for interactive session . .. hands-on , i mean . mma: i really like the novelty factor of it - if you are up for it we could prepare and deliver the workshop together plus whoever wants to join the party - i will hash out an abstract and share it with you asap . sure , i am up for it . we can discuss this further once you are done with next week\\u2019s arrangement . right , you needed to the abstract before the 14 ? right - i wish hash out something quick and put it up on google drive and then we can iterate on it together , it does not have to be long . <@u0kv7fvnv> made that pr about setup . py in gitink . thank you :slightly_smiling_face: . @pinja i think you can allocate 9:00-10:30 for your sections (more if you need) so there is no rush , if you finish earlier , that is not a problem but i plan to start 10:45 after a coffee break 10:30-10:45 . wrong handle: <@u21p57pkr> . <@u0kv7fvnv> the ci lesson is still missing , so it will take the rest of the time . ah - good :slightly_smiling_face: . how will the participants get in next week before we give them the access cards ? the meeting room is in the visitor area . we just have to keep only one locked door open , jam it with something . i now have a *very* simple jenkins thingy set up , in case i want to show it live . very cool ! i was just informed that our joint norway-north america proposal partnering with software carpentry was not approved - we will try again in future . that was a quick decision ! too bad , but it\\u2019s always a lottery . better luck next time . as we gain traction this may again become an opportunity . keep up the good work ! thanks yes i think this will work out eventually - i will keep the good contacts with swc on this . the proposal got rejected mainly because it has too little student focus and too much focus on researchers . and well ... this was exactly our focus . the reviewer was super focused on student mobility and we had zero of that in our proposal - conclusion for me is that we tried to sell a good idea to the \"wrong\" audience . <@u2234ay5a> in the install instructions we ask people to download the professional one , but isn\\'t that the one that costs money (eventually) ? if yes , we should recommend the community one imo . that is the intention (to ask try pro) , the idea of the session is to show that ides are a common good , that is why the \"mightiest\" will be shown . i plan to explain that after they can switch to community , or educational , or even ninja ide . will it disrupt your session if we recommend community and then you can also demo pro and people can rather upgrade and not \"downgrade\" ? as a participant i would be very hesitant to install anything commercial with a trial period because i know that i will forget to cancel the trial period and then pay . community version lacks a profiler , so , if possible i\\'d like to stick with pro version , but i can simply demo this part if that is critical . there is no \"pay\" , sw just won\\'t start anymore ... sorry for being difficult but i would prefer us to advocate free and community but please do demo the pro version in your talk and please show the profiling - is this acceptable to you ? if yes , then i can adapt the install instruction text . i would in the text mention that for the full experience it is ok and easy to download the 30 day trial pro version which is needed for the profiling part - ok ? yeah , sure , let it be so) . thanks :slightly_smiling_face: . :+1: . mac people , i need your help on this: <https://coderefinery . github . io/installation/osx/> (gfortran , gcc , g++ , make , cmake , visual diffing: diffuse ? not sure what is popular on the mac) . i have unfortunately zero experience on mac . mac users get open software packages with brew or port . i use port . what are you using <@u21ph491q> ? . in doubt we can document both routes ? i also hear that people use either the one or the other . i think most use both because the packages are broken for the one or the other . i have used gitx for visually looking at git repos - <http://gitx . frim . nl/index . html> don\\u2019t have experience with diffuse . i am out-office the rest of the week , but i can make a port doc on monday . for meld i will point people to the meld page , seems that it is available through port/brew and i will say that there are alternatives if people like it better . <@u2k0egsc8> ok i think i need to send it out tomorrow but we will figure it out no problem . thanks harsha - this is useful and we can mention it live or in the docs . i indeed use both brew and port . there is not much left - only compilers and make . this link seems to give very good instructions for installing gnu compilers on osx: <https://wiki . helsinki . fi/display/hugg/gnu+compiler+install+on+mac+os+x> . what is this website ? thanks - we can link to it . the install instructions are now announced , fingers crossed - thanks to all for great work on it ! there are also other alternatives for package management on os x , see <https://www . slant . co/topics/511/~mac-package-managers> . i only used macports so far \\u2026 maybe i should try homebrew . my colleagues who use mac prefer brew and curse at ports - but this is just anecdotal , i have no own data on this . dear all , particular <@u23htrtjt> <@u2234ay5a> <@u21ph491q> <@u21p57pkr> - everything under control ? i was busy with admin things but i will work like a madman this weekend and clean up my material - for the example code let\\'s go with the csv reader reading the fav ice cream and colors and stuff , monday/tuesday we harmonize the material and wednesday is showtime . everybody else , please help out going through the devops , jupyter , and git-collaborative material - please ask if it is not clear where it is , cmake and documentation material still needs cleanup and is too inconsistent but feel free to peek into it . automated testing , modular code development , and code complexity material still needs to be distilled from other talks this weekend . < ! channel> (sorry for spam to those not directly involved) please help with feedback to <https://github . com/coderefinery/git-intro> , <https://github . com/coderefinery/jupyter> , <https://github . com/coderefinery/automation> , <https://github . com/coderefinery/git-collaborative> . i have my part under control , but it will require some work this weekend . cool ! but any comments or critique is highly welcomed ! jupyter looks very good - for me installation of numba failed and i had to comment it out of requirements . txt , i am using arch-like linux - just for info , it is maybe not a big deal . this one is ready for review/feedback: <https://coderefinery . github . io/documentation/> - tomorrow moving on to testing , modular code development , managing complexity . <@u0kv7fvnv> thanks for letting me know about numba . i\\u2019ll try to be prepared for that in the workshop . fyi the cmake lesson will be built around fizz-buzz: <https://github . com/bast/fizz-buzz/tree/solution> (this is not the actual solution , we will refine the solution further , wip) . i have not yet added my self to <http://coderefinery . org/team/> , i will do this as soon as i have time to figure out how this works . <@u2k0z6mdg> install jekyll , clone <https://github . com/coderefinery/coderefinery . org> , git grep for text of other team members , then you will see , test it locally (jekyll serve) before pushing . any feedback on lessons under automation ? already got some and will make the changes tomorrow . would like to get more feedback possibly today , if possible . i will go through the automation lessons today . will update you by evening . as to automation: i did not go through it in detail yet - will try today - if we need to download some big files we need to advertise it early so that people can possibly download it before the course so that we don\\'t start all pulling big files over an innocent wifi access point . the exercise in the ci part is imo not super clear on the jenkins part (not sure what people need to do there) , also we will use travis in my testing part on the day before but it is no problem to repeat or use travis also in your section . in my part we will implement some tests on this data: <https://github . com/bast/data-example> and deploy to travis and coveralls . i will write the testing lesson today on planes . i will briefly mention jenkins in the testing part with one sentence but not go into any more depth - this means that if the exercise in automation is about jenkins , that\\'s very good . i would mention some real-life examples of services here: <https://coderefinery . github . io/automation/03-cloud/> . i would possibly also split the tools part thematically into configuration management tools and container things (if that division makes sense) . i will need feedback on this one <https://coderefinery . github . io/documentation/> (ideally issues or prs but slack is ok too) . the jenkins part is menat to contain a demonstration also , to clear things up . i\\'ll add some screen shot etc . to jenkins , and some text related to those . great ! you don\\'t have to be super explicit in the exercise but it is good to add few key steps . some people will be a bit behind and might miss an important point that you demonstrate and then it is nice if they can read it up but no need to write it out super explicitly either . changing topic - everybody please register here: <http://ahm17 . neic . nordforsk . org/registration/> and arrange travel . <@u2k0egsc8> what tool did you use to make that image ? is it something simple that i\\'ve just missed . i used keynote - comes with the mac . ahh , that explains why it looked like the ones made by scott chacon (nice guy btw) . i would appreciate if somebody with mac could clone this: <https://github . com/bast/fizz-buzz> , check out \"solution\" branch , try \"mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build &amp;&amp; cmake .. &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test\" - it would be great if you could tell me whether this compiles and test passes on mac . i will soon add testing on travis but would be great to know for me until then . <@u23htrtjt> you met scott chacon ? yeah , he was in finland a few years back and github paid everyone\\'s beers at the afterparty . <@u0kv7fvnv> the fizzbuzz example builds and executes succesfully on mac . super . thanks ! <@u0kv7fvnv> it works for me as well , only this cmake warning: \"cmake warning (dev): policy cmp0042 is not set: macosx_rpath is enabled by default . run \"cmake --help-policy cmp0042\" for policy details . use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning . \" . apparently i don\\'t have a fortran compiler . ahh , right i didn\\'t have gcc at all , silly me . got the policy statement as well , but suppressed it in my feedback:slightly_smiling_face: . <@u21p57pkr> i am bit uncertain about the puppet example . since we are not installing puppet (right ? ) , i think it is more confusing - it the sense that a newbie will try to fit it with vagrant and ansible . since ansible uses yuml , i dare suggest exemplifing yuml/ansible instead of ruby/puppet . bjornlin i could remove the puppet example . <@u21p57pkr> it will probably be clearer without puppet , yes . arrived in espoo - i will see you tomorrow morning at csc . thanks for feedback on mac cmp0042 - i will fix that . for the automated testing i will probably not use the csv , sorry , i need to keep it super simple and will focus only on the collaborative travis part - i guess it is not a huge problem if we don\\'t use the same example throughout , for the testing i will provide all the code (some simple functions , no classes) but we will activate it together in steps - for the modularization part i might use the csv - will work on that tomorrow . i will probably build the pytest exercise around this: <https://coderefinery . github . io/testing/05-pytest/> - need to brainstorm more tomorrow - csv testing is tricky to explain in little time for people completely new to python - what i will try here is to provide the code and people will uncomment it in steps - my hope is that the code is self explanatory if you first look at the test and then at the code . hey radovan ! is it just me or does kramdown randomly insert line breaks to where there should be no line breaks ? apparently kramdown has a configuration option called hard_wrap that is true by default and has to be switched to false . i got feedback on installation instructions: . 1 . fortran-magic $ conda install fortran-magic fetching package metadata ....... solving package specifications: . packagenotfounderror: package not found: \\'\\' package missing in current linux-64 channels: - fortran-magic you can search for packages on <http://anaconda . org|anaconda . org> with anaconda search -t conda fortran-magic 2 . vagrant at <https://www . vagrantup . com/downloads . html> there is no ubuntu package and at <https://www . vagrantup . com/docs/installation/> they imply ( ? ) that you should not use $ sudo apt-get install vagrant . i will create two issues on that in <https://github . com/coderefinery/installation> . yeah i have problems with fortran-magic when i try the pouta blueprints service as well , and i don\\u2019t understand it yet . it\\u2019s a very minor example in the jupyter material , and i might even skip it . i suspect the container doesn\\'t have a fortran compiler or bindings . thor , you can maybe add to the install instructions that it is ok if that step fails - you don\\'t have to take it out completely since it might work sometimes - if you fix it , please also close the issue . works fine in my machine for instance . <@u21ph491q> did you want pouta blueprints accounts for people tomorrow afternoon ? yeah i think it\\'s good to have as backup solution , thanks . we have an invite system so we can send them invitation emails . i expect nearly everyone to have installed jupyter successfully , so probably it\\u2019s a bit overkill to send everyone an invite . shall we wait until tomorrow morning and in the welcoming address ask if anyone needs it ? yes , i can send the invites during lunch . that sounds good , cheers . phew , i think i\\'m starting to get close . did someone require proofreading or commenting at such a late hour ? i\\'ll pick up the thermoses and come to debatti . i am almost ready with the testing part - needs one more hour - if you want to have a look here: <https://coderefinery . github . io/documentation/> that would be helpful for me . i\\'ll come down . ok if you want we can browse the git-intro . i have added links to tomorrow\\'s material: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2016-12-14-espoo/> . link to our collaborative writing pad: <http://bit . ly/coderefinery-csc> . <@u2k0egsc8> i have started drafting some text for the neic 2017 workshop in the google drive under workshops - it would be great if you could add some thoughts and make an iteration . thank you ! timer for breaks - <http://timer . onlineclock . net/> . good luck with the workshop ! do you record video ? <@u0kv7fvnv> i made an iteration . thanks ! no video yet - we will do it in some later workshop . thanks <@u2k0egsc8> . <@u23htrtjt> i have bought the post-its and fruit for tomorrow . great . hey . how are you doing ? nervous about tomorrow :slightly_smiling_face: . just read through my session , getting nervous too . sorry for catching up late - tough day - we got very good feedback . don\\'t worry you guys will do great - i am sure . :slightly_smiling_face: . is it ok if you link your material on the website ? sure , yeah , it will be a bit tuned , but yea . s/if you link/if i link/ . no problem to tune it at the last minute - just that i don\\'t forget to link it , people won\\'t be checking it before the session i think . please link or tell me how . to . clone the <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> - then have a look under _workshops/*espoo* - then it should be hopefully clear - if not , i can add it . done . thanks ! btw . did u go through csvwrangler example already ? (jyry) . sorry we did not do it - we moved to more basic examples - hope it does not throw your session off course . if you use it (sorry did not check the latest version yet) , then keep it and take all the time you need to slowly walk people through it , we won\\'t do anything else in the afternoon so you don\\'t have to rush . i ask because when try to run , it asks for file . probably the file to read . i wonder do we have that (statistics , remember) ? or i can switch to some easier example . good idea acutallly . the conclusion from first two days is the easier the better . feel free to use this: <https://github . com/bast/data-example> . but feel free to not use it if you have better example :slightly_smiling_face: . thanks . <@u2234ay5a> do keep in mind there\\'s a bug in the code that computes the mean . \"whoopsie\" . <@u0kv7fvnv> did you have time to make a course certificate ? i could jump outside to print it . ill probably use another example . <@u0kv7fvnv> could u help with styling ? <https://coderefinery . github . io/ides/01-introduction-to-ides/> . conventions action win/lin keys mac keys key combinations ctrl + shift + a \\u2318 \\u21e7 a - this part is actually a table :disappointed: . <@u23htrtjt> i told the students that i will email/snail mail the certificate , had not time to do it sadly . md vs html ? i heard , just asked about 5 minutes before you said it :slightly_smiling_face: . ah you are here :slightly_smiling_face: . looking at it <@u2234ay5a> . thnx . hopefully better now - please check . you can also write pure html - it should work . the problem is missing border or what is the problem ? formatting and border etc . probably need html . probably - markdown itself has limited support for tables . there\\'s quite a bit of things to install . perhaps we should have only instructions for things to install for the first day and then instruct the installing of tools for the next day . yes good point - we need to rework the install routine . please note these observations down here: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1b31whulkkwhjd-d9-pf_mc6liwsezsmoscvyt99tr7m/edit> - we will talk about them next week in our meeting (i know that not everybody can attend , please write your improvements and observations for future workshops) . the document is in the workshops folder - please note all lessons learned - i will also soon process feedback . the link doesn\\'t work . odd , i\\'m able to find it in drive though . maybe i did a copy paste fail , please access through drive . it\\'s actually the - at the end of the url . thanks - corrected . thanks to everybody involved for a successful workshop ! great work everybody ! so far only thor , bjoern , erik and me are registered for all hands meeting - i have spoken to nikolai and understand that he has to wait a bit before he can commit to it , i also know that harsha has a scheduling conflict with another event - how about the others ? i have typed up the feedback post-its: you find it on the drive under workshops/espoo-2016/feedback - i think it is generally very good , it is also very detailed and very useful - i think it tells us exactly what we can improve - don\\'t take all negative feedback personally , you can never make everybody happy - great job everybody ! thanks <@u2k0egsc8> for the workshop abstract ! i will need to trim it a bit - it needs to be shorter - will submit it tonight with you in copy . last meeting of the year: monday 12:00 cet/ 13:00 eet - agenda: course feedback and stockholm course schedule adjustments . <https://www . linkedin . com/company/10953141 ? trk=tyah&amp;trkinfo=clickedvertical%3acompany%2centitytype%3aentityhistoryname%2cclickedentityid%3acompany_10953141%2cidx%3a1> . can\\'t make it to today\\'s meeting , the internet connection is too sluggish . ok - just to reconfirm <@u21p57pkr> you are not planning to go to the stockholm workshop , right ? just need to know so that we can plan the schedule a bit . i\\'ve been under assumption that i\\'m not going there . i\\'ll do a quick reboot and hope that solves all my microphone issues . be back in a few minutes . in two minutes we meet here: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/sn7rt3wmgvcxhn363xj3owg4iue> . it would be really cool if we could do a distributed git example as an introductory exercise . everyone forks a repository on gh , clones , adds a file with a free-form description and makes a pull-request and then we start merging pull requests and introducing people . then once that\\'s been done we start from the very basics of what a commit and a repository are . might be cognitively burdensome though . hmm ... intriguing - what would be the goal of the exercise ? (the goals that i can see is to get used to github early and introduce people at the same time and motivate where we want to get to in two days , i wonder though whether this exercise will add understanding at this point) . what i find a tiny bit problematic is to put personal info into a place that people don\\'t fully have under control - so you submit info about yourself but you might not know where it goes to and how to remove it later - that is easier with a google doc i think which we can later wipe . i was thinking about the introducing part . plus also motivating the end point that we are going to get to with the git narrative . hmm ... or maybe we could introduce teachers that way in the beginning and say that we are going to do the same later in in the git narrative . i like the motivating aspect of it but worry that it could be confusing/opaque at that stage - what do others think ? i still think that it might be easier to start from local development and later go to remote and to github but perhaps i am wrong and the opposite works as well . i agree with the risk about confusion . forgot to schedule next online meeting: monday jan 9 12:00 cet , 13:00 eet . <@u21ph491q> pdc will sponsor coffee breaks at the stockholm workshops - thanks to <@u0a9nv7px> for arranging this . we will need to acknowledge that on the website . <@u0kv7fvnv>: i\\'ve commented the csc workshop feedback , and i think i can totally agree with your lessons learned . congratulations on the team for delivering such an intensive first workshop ! thanks for comments ! i have commented on those . the homework , project work , and credits would be nice to have but is very difficult to achieve (i have given a course in feb 2016 with project work and credits and it was an incredible amount of work for me) . non scholae sed vitae . :slightly_smiling_face: . great that pdc can sponsor coffee breaks . caela sent me advice on how to order , to i\\u2019ll do that ~2 weeks before the workshop . godt nytt\\xe5r , <@u0kv7fvnv> . started the year with uploading bio&amp;picture . thanks ! happy new year everybody - hope you all had some nice relaxing vacation ! let us boot into an exciting 2017 . i think it would be good to get more diversity into our material and i would like to share the cmake session with <@u2k0egsc8> - let\\'s talk about it soon and plan . also <@u23htrtjt> suggested to take some of \"my\" sessions from the second day - i think this is a good idea , also to get more diversity in - which part would interest you most jyry ? <@u23htrtjt> <@u2k0egsc8> <@u2234ay5a> we should soon start planning travel and hotel for stockholm . and i would like us to form an infrastructure team and start working with me on deploying our services - i am thinking that this could be interesting for <@u21p57pkr> and <@u2l0js68k> and <@u2b3dh142> but first i want to hear whether this is really up your alley :slightly_smiling_face: . everybody who would like to join the infrastructure team and who would enjoy running a nordic wide service which (imo) will get lots of attention and visibility is most welcome to raise your hand . i do not quite follow your \\u201cinfrastructure team\\u201d , <@u0kv7fvnv> - what do you have in mind ? ok what i meant is that we need to soon launch our gitlab + ci service - and i think it would be good if we have a team of people running this , not just one person - at the beginning it is manageable by one but if we are several , we document things better and later when we hopefully reach scale , we can load level the maintenance effort between 2-3 people . more specifically it means that we need imo at least 2 persons who oversee the deploy and status of a gitlab instance and keep it alive while it scales - we might deploy the gitlab in partnership with csc - jyry knows more details about csc plans along this line - we may need to program a little auth layer in front of gitlab . depending on how the csc partnership on gitlab turns out , we may also buy the service from e . g . <http://githost . io|githost . io> - imo we need some beta level service up by latest march otherwise we run the risk of being too late to get users on the service and to get a convincing case for a follow up of the project . from discussing with people my feeling is that the need for such a service is huge and if we do it right , we will get many people on the service . we start with the git repo , later we add ci to it , i would also like to develop the code sharing platform as 3rd component . just for info in nird (norwegian infrastructure) we are also going to have the ci/cd pipeline and gitlab to deploy apps to kubernetes \\u2026 that might be of interest but march is too optimistic for us to say that you guys can use it .. i would say around end of april or may for us . <@u23htrtjt> <@u2k0egsc8> <@u2234ay5a> in case it helps with planning your trip to stockholm , i\\'ve put together some advise on local accommodation for another event . <https://events . prace-ri . eu/event/502/page/0> . thx . thanks gurvinder - let\\'s talk about it at ahm . yeah we can discuss there in more detail .. i would definitely like to learn from you guys and possibly team up to avoid reinventing the wheel . as to stockholm , i normally stay here: <https://ligula . se/motel-l/> because it is good and relatively cheap but it is not super close to the campus which is a drawback so it would require waking up 30 minutes earlier . thanks . i have also stayed at hotel arcadia (elite hotels) - very close but not super cheap , and at rex hotel , walking distance and relatively cheap but also claustrophobic but i did not mind , was fine for me . we don\\'t have to stay at the same place but it makes logistics easier - is more fun to have breakfast and dinners together . i do not mind a 30 minutes walk - motel l is fine for me . do you plan to arrive on sunday evening ? motel l requires taking the metro - yes i plan to arrive on sunday but don\\'t know the time yet , probably not too late - have made bad experience with tight connections late in the evening and it is tough to arrive at 1 am before the workshop :slightly_smiling_face: . seems i can be at arlanda at 20:00 on sunday . leave in the evening wednesday (20:35) . <http://www . geant . org/services/trust_identity_and_security/edugain> . edugain looks interesting but the two questions that i have are whether \"all\" universities in the nordics support it and whether we can distinguish nordic and non-nordic . i still think that an invite code system or a easy web based registration review system would be \"good enough\" . i am a bit worried that if we go for a \"proper\" edugain etc . solution it will take long time to implement because we will have to negotiate with many places . hardware-wise we don\\'t have to get it right from the start . i would like us to implement a solution which we can migrate to another service (kubernetes etc . ) within few hours . if we have such a system , we also get good backup and we don\\'t have to worry too much to get everything right on first go . i fear that finding a system that works for all universities and institutions and convince all those places to implement it can take many months . one way to not worry about people changing emails and work places would be google oauth where new users are blocked by default and get unblocked as soon as they motivate why they should get on the service , or we have invite codes , or both . then if they change emails , it is their problem and not ours and if they move from one university to another , not our problem . downside: not everybody enjoys selling their soul to google . i can recommend checking out <https://docs . dataporten . no/> for authn .. as this will take care of connecting your service to edugain (coming in few months) or authn users from social networks .. we use this our service like notebook , apache spark , nextcloud stuff . we can talk about this too at neic ahm if you want . thanks ! yes i am looking forward to discuss this . <@u0kv7fvnv> , do you have a link to the program for the ahm ? sure: <http://ahm17 . neic . nordforsk . org/schedule/> . or do you mean for our team session ? thx , i was looking for the main program . hey , when is the next time we are having a coderef meeting ? today at 12:00 cet . thnx . i will draft an agenda in the next few minutes - feel free to edit . hi , sorry for the absence today , it simply slipped my mind ! can someone point to the location of the url to the recommended place to stay in stockholm in feb ? one more ... do we book ourselves or centralized by neic ? bj\\xf8rn and i will stay in <https://ligula . se/motel-l/> - it is good but not super close . the hotels that are close are 500 sek/night more expensive . we would need to leave hotel around 8 to be at the workshop place before 9 i think . ideally you book yourself and reimburse via your employer who invoices neic . <@u21ph491q> please have a look at the minutes - the most relevant for you is that i would like you to take the lead on organizing the feb workshop (which you already do) - please also consult the trello card and feel free to edit , i would like you to be in charge in \"kicking our butts\" so that we have things in place - with my input - at the same time we can document what we do so that it is easier for future organizers , does that sound ok ? bonus about motel-l is that it is close to soedermalm which is a good area to have dinner and drinks . that sounds good @bash . take the trello card as starting point but we don\\'t have to follow blindly - if something does not make sense , we change it . and thanks for organizing it - i will help you with it . regarding adding oneself to the neic website , i don\\u2019t have permissions to push to the repository , can someone add me ? you can also file a pull request . (i don\\'t think i have permissions to add you) . regarding the info on the team website: thor is really not there: <https://neic . nordforsk . org/about/team/> &lt;https://neic . nordforsk . org/about/team/#wikfeldt&gt; somehow it would make more sense to refer to the <http://coderefinery . org/team/> website from the <https://neic . nordforsk . org/about/team/coderefinery/> . (at least do it additionally) . right - we are already tracking this issue: <https://github . com/neicnordic/neicweb/issues/5> . personally i would love to not duplicate the info . i was reminded that our info on the neic website is incomplete which is true - ideally i would love to have the info in one place otherwise it is guaranteed to diverge . i\\u2019ve added myself again , following the new instructions . hope it works . thanks ! good conference: <http://www . rse . ac . uk/conf2017 . html> - i will most def go . dear all , we need to somehow snapshot the course material that we have used in espoo before we modify it for the next courses . i see two options: 1) freezing repos by cloning them (don\\'t like this idea since it will create many clones over time) . 2) create an attic repo which will hold generated html from certain hashes (requires some manual work but can be scripted) . do you see more options ? with cicero it is easy to snapshot but not with jekyll . alternatively we decide not to snapshot but this can be confusing for people who revisit all material which then changes under their feet . s/all/old/ . 2) may become a super bloat over time . tags and a script to build all repos using a given tag ? plus then something where to put the built product , which i don\\'t have a good understanding of . i agree with tags and script - do we need to serve the product or can we assume that people can install jekyll ? i feel we need to serve the stuff . then a repository lots of subpages containing the various implementations . and a process for teachers tagging and somebody(tm) building all the sites and linking to the course site . yep that\\'s the way to go , i will experiment a bit but somebody else (tm) is always welcome . that sounds like a good approach . yesterday i actually tagged the solutions branch of the jupyter material as v1 . 0 . speaking of new material , one change i would like to implement for stockholm is to list recommended reading close to the respective material , other changes: better styling , id anchors to headings . do we want tags like \"stockholm-2017\" ? or major . minor ? thanks for using an annotated tag - it\\'s better than lightweight tags since we see who tagged . yeah maybe stockholm-2017 , or even stockholm-feb2017 , is better . i was just going to comment that the first thing is to settle on the naming convention . other opinions ? both major . minor and place-time has pros/cons what do others prefer ? it\\'s also fine to use both , tags are cheap . the heading anchors are now implemented in the latest jekyll-common . dear all , sorry to say that i need to cancel our virtual meeting tomorrow (monday) - the reason for this is a phd defense of a colleague which i cannot miss - i will see some of you the week after , i will also communicate issues and progress with you over slack here on the coderefinery channel and in 1-on-1s so that we keep in sync - please mark feb 6 12:00 cet/13:00 eet as our next meeting . good luck to your colleague . thanks :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u23htrtjt> i will give the complexity talk at an unrelated workshop and i will use it as an excuse to improve some parts of it that i was not happy with - feel free to consider these then or not :slightly_smiling_face: just fyi . roger . <@u21ph491q> i will now introduce you into the black arts of using typeform and emailing participants since i should not hold it all in my head - i will walk you through the procedure and we will document what we do , then it becomes reproducible for other workshops - please create a user on typeform and give me the username - everybody else who wants to be able to access registration data can do the same . <@u0kv7fvnv> alright great . i\\u2019ll create an account asap , a bit tied up right now but hopefully in an hour or two . is that okay ? it\\'s ok even tomorrow or later but we should slowly start , not super urgent today . we will document all steps and routines as transparently as it makes sense so that we can later point workshop maintainers and possibly even registrants to it . <@u2l0js68k> how is the scouting going for cph course room/dates ? i am already getting requests by email from potential participants . you need any assistance from me ? is there a coderefinery mailinglist ? i just got an email from prace workpackage 6 that they are thinking about a potential prace gitlab service . i would like to forward it to you fyi . no mailinglist , but forward the email to me , <@u0a9nv7px> . done . some points from yellows discussion: 1 . we should consider emphasizing \"installation\" or other soft software quality measurements during our sessions 2 . might be wise to talk to dan still (glenna ll) about having e . g . gitlab via glenna 3 . coderefinery trainings could be useful to neic\\'s own project teams (like internal sessions) . apparently everyone and their dog wants to have a gitlab installation and have someone else maintain it :slightly_smiling_face: . <https://about . gitlab . com/2017/01/23/video-tutorial-idea-to-production-on-google-container-engine-gke/> kubernetes and gitlab . in nbis (sweden bioinformatic resource\\u2026) we decided to pay github for this , an educational account is quite cheap and there\\u2019s no chance we would be able to run it cheaper , or more stable than github . we are thinking about a forum where people can ask things , we will discuss it at the team session . educational github is cool but last time i tried to get one , it was limited to two years and that was too short time window for the project that i wanted to move to github . <@u21ph491q> <https://www . sintef . no/projectweb/geilowinterschool/program/> . prestkampen room almost same location as skeikampen , but go further through the bar until the end of it . meeting minutes: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1gemtkx_yckr3wkhcw9w-11x7jip-3fp9qtci8cvpm5i/edit> . to sync those who were not there yesterday , please browse the meeting minutes (i will create trello cards out of the todo items) , we have agreed to be present on slack each monday morning , next meeting is feb 6 - nikolai created a google calendar which contains meetings and will contain milestones and deadlines . hope everyone had some nice time in norway :slightly_smiling_face: i have preliminary set the dates for the may event in copenhagen . would 9-11th of may suit everyone ? let me know so that i can book everything . thanks lukasz , the dates are ok for me but we need at least two more teachers (copenhagen is beautiful that time of the year ! ) . i will be traveling monday morning but please also discuss it without me here on slack . ideally we should be 3 or 4 instructors . i doubt i\\u2019ll be able to make it to copenhagen , my wife plans to defend her thesis mid-late may and i should be there to help with stuff if needed . sure . please chat about it on monday here and let us find a conclusion by monday evening . mother-in-law paid us a visit , relaxed recovery from the ahm . hi guys . did nothing special saturday , but took our daughter to skansen (<http://www . skansen . se/>) on sunday . apart from seeing animals , one key purpose was to leave her pacifier with the cats ! it\\u2019s an old tradition , you drop the pacifier into a room full of cats who play with them , and one gets a \\u201ccertificate\\u201d :slightly_smiling_face: . travel to oslo on thursday after the ahm . we were invited to a party on saturday . my wife arrived friday and we look forward to a relaxed weekend together with friends . saturday morning our daughter called . turned out she had picked up a heavy flu . i had to rebook the flight home and do nursing . no party . i had an incredibly uneventful weekend . i should have more of those :slightly_smiling_face: . nice - for me it was laundry and baking :slightly_smiling_face: . who would like to go to and teach in copenhagen 9-11th of may ? i am going , lukasz will be helper this time , we need at least 2 people more - if the dates are bad , we need to move but lukasz needs to know about the room reservation . i cannot leave trondheim that week , unfortunately . <@u0kv7fvnv> as mikkeller beer festival starts on 12th of may i just might be persuaded :wink: . apparently there are also some tickets left for the day session . cool ! how are these days for <@u2k0z6mdg> ? i made a simple spreadsheet from the trello board for workshop planning . it\\u2019s under workshops &gt; stockholm-2017-feb . it\\u2019s very basic and maybe it would be convenient to have more features . let me know if you have ideas . thank you ! we need to send out the info mail - i am on it . ok good . also <@u2b3dh142> <@u2234ay5a> <@u21p57pkr> - are you up to teach in copenhagen ? <@u0kv7fvnv> count me in ! (if we do have enough budget :slightly_smiling_face: ) . i\\'m available for copenhagen as well . yes . count me in for copenhagen . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i cannot find the email addresses for the participants in the espoo-workshop . do you have them off-google-docs ? (could be to early for me :slightly_smiling_face:) . yes i have them (i guess this is for the spreadsheet ? ) - in which format do you ideally need the info ? <@u0kv7fvnv> , csv , excel , doc , txt - i\\u2019ll manage . and this is used to create our contact spreadsheet right ? (if yes , that\\'s very good since i want this to be more transparent to us) . yes . ok i will send you the data over email . as to copenhagen workshop - thanks for raising your hands ! it looks like we have the team , now we need a rough program - what topics are closest to your hearts ? <@u2b3dh142> what topic would you like to teach ? sorry , in may i will be away . i can teach following topics , if they are still available . - devops , ci/cd , integrated development environments , managing complexity (in general) . introduction to version control systems . apparently <http://gitlab . com|gitlab . com> is down and now <https://www . youtube . com/embed/nc0hpgersd4 ? autoplay=1&amp;auto_play=true> . we are so living in the future . reminder: we meet on monday - tentative agenda under meetings/ in the google drive , please add points and feel also free to expand points . good morning everyone , had a lovely weekend outdoors . it\\'s not often i\\'m this happy to be in at the office where it\\'s warm and dry . good morning ! that sounds nice . i also spent saturday outside , doing nordic skating on a lake . yesterday i saw a cool show called limits (by cirkus cirk\\xf6r) with colleagues from the csc school at kth , it was their christmas present to employees last year . slackbot seems energetic today ... i think someone rebooted him . slackbot:who is here . yes he is still not ai . good morning ! hey , had a typical trip to tallinn for the weekend , shopping , bar hopping ... :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u0kv7fvnv> does neic have access to any openshift instance ? i see that kubernetes is widely discussed in different neic projects . if we have access to openshift , we can provide ci/cd without additional effort . check this video - <https://www . youtube . com/watch ? v=m0nyhpue5ru> . i didn\\'t know estonians do trips to tallinn too . after a while , after a while ... god morning everyone . i entered the flue fog on thursday and managed to escape yesterday , very dizzy . today is i little better , but my mind crawls . if i am able to get up to half-speed in 5 minutes today , i will be satisfied . for me it was coding all weekend to run behind a deadline , on the plus side the sun is back here which makes a huge difference . <@u2b3dh142> that looks pretty cool - i don\\'t know whether openshift is running anywhere (you can ask this on <#c050v61rb|general>) . i have to get a separate headset for video calls . somehow hangouts doesn\\'t like using the internal microphone in my mac . <@u2k0z6mdg> , you weren\\'t at the group call but i\\'d like to discuss updating the material for the introductory git . i\\'d like to re-group the session to more discrete pieces of talking and doing . is it ok for you if i can do that this week and you can look it up next week ? thanks jyry - indeed i would like you two to sync a bit about the refactoring of the git intro . <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u2l0js68k> we now have a shared google calendar that holds meetings - let me know if you don\\'t have access to it yet - if you cannot attend a meeting , you need to let me know in advance otherwise planning becomes hard . regarding the coffee breaks , will it be good to order coffee and snacks to arrive outside the lecture room at 10:30 and 15:00 every day ? i don\\u2019t remember exactly what times we had breaks in espoo . yes i think these are good time slots . sorry for disappearing , i had problems with my train and was late to arrive . let me go through the git mayerial . how was the resbaz ? <@u0kv7fvnv> , it was good many people attended the courses , but for the open talks very poor attendance . what are the open talks ? and what were the courses on ? in other words what worked and what didn\\'t and what would you change next time ? <http://www . ub . uio . no/english/courses-events/events/ureal/2017/170202_presentations> . interest on posters were poor as well . not sure where the open talks are on that website . what are the lessons learned from your perspective ? may be open is the wrong word , the taks were about , tsd , edugain , norstor ... lessen is targeted advertising . without sending general emails to lists . what would you do differently next time ? which talks went well ? how many people showed actually up ? i also don\\'t believe too much in general email lists for this . this was organized mainly my science library and lex was handling the sofrware carpentry part .. with that setup there is nothing much i can influence . what the library people think is important for scientists are very different what i think . for example during a discussion latex was desided as more relevent to scientists . than a lecture on what services usit . has to offer offer . who is this: <https://github . com/baileqi> ? we now have a museum page: <https://github . com/coderefinery/museum> - see the freezer . sh script . did not succeed with jekyll and updateing the coderefinery team pages . what is the steps with jekyll ? have you managed to run the site locally on your computer ? not fully , i got some pages like the description of my self , but there was nothing else . that was after \\u2018jekyll build\\u2019 . you have better proposal . ? .. first encounter with jekyll . sorry for counter question but independently of your profile , are you able to serve the <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> page locally which looks the same as <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> ? .. after haveing made the . bundle :flushed: , i am . pictures on the team page are squeezed if the browser window width is in [768 , 1199) pixels (firefox on macos) . thanks <@u052rl9cu> indeed they are :slightly_smiling_face: <https://github . com/coderefinery/coderefinery . org/issues/5> . very good <@u2k0egsc8> this is important because also all the lesson stuff is on jekyll and we all need to be able to debug things locally before pushing to the live sites . <@u2k0egsc8> now the followup question: can you see yourself on the team page locally ? no , and i have done a git pull .. i think . it could be an issue with encoding (\"oe\") . .. i\\u2019ll check . let me know if you don\\'t get it to work and i will look at it , i suspect encoding and it is possible that my implementation did not anticipate that . but thanks for reporting <@u052rl9cu> . nope , could it be the style . the page is kind of \\u201cfull\\u201d with four pictures in each row . mine becomes the 9th on a new row . ok i will check . leaving for today - talk to you tomorrow . ok . do we know who user \"baileqi\" is on github ? s/he is part of our org on github , perhaps added by mistake . i will now remove the person , please complain if i manage to remove one of you . <@u2k0egsc8> i have fixed the page . please see: <https://github . com/coderefinery/coderefinery . org/commit/f8acc514864bf114d2472af50e401555e6b12d87> . i think you copied code rendered by github which auto-rendered the yaml code . we have some web gurus in the room , can somebody please take <https://github . com/coderefinery/coderefinery . org/issues/5> ? thanks , <@u0kv7fvnv> . i\\'ll send you the ruislimmppu recipe in return :grinning: . yes please ! :slightly_smiling_face: . wrt img aspect ratio , maybe the following css code works ? thanks thomas ! i would really like somebody else than me to fix it by first testing it locally . a feedback from espoo course i got today via email: \"and yet again thanks for the course ! i\\u2019ve been getting so much more out of git and also i\\u2019ve made good progress in trying to convince my colleagues to use it . \" . encouraging feedback ! <@u2k0z6mdg> is organizing this event: <http://www . uio . no/english/services/it/research/events/coderefinery-2017-april . html> which (in my understanding) is more about discussing and listening to researchers than teaching . i think this is a very good initiative and indeed we need to do a better job at reaching out and listening to the needs . i am thinking that it could be fun to organize a 1-day event also in stockholm where we invite people to bring their codes , to ask us anything and where we learn from what people need and do live consulting . you are suggesting extending the stockholm event with one more day ? i like the oslo-seminar approach , by the way . it\\'s too late for it now i think but some time later . i also think it\\u2019s a good idea . the question is when , is this spring perhaps a bit full already ? im totally willing to organize it for e . g . may though . i was also thinking about not earlier than may - this event can be super useful if we prepare it well , it will take some time to let the right people know , the risk is that nobody shows up so we need to communicate this well . we would need to find a format where people feel comfortable sharing their experiences and troubles with code , bonus would be that we offer good consulting on site for free . we could either do freestyle (dangerous) , plenum (perhaps scary) , or in groups (less diversity in opinions) . thor , it\\'s great that you feel up to the task , please brainstorm a bit , we have time , but it will require some thinking - if we do it well , it can be super fun and also win win for everybody . in the make/cmake session i am touch upon make\\u2019s implicit rules , but i am taken a back by the fact that \\u2018hello . x: hello . cpp\\u2019 (with out any explicit build command) do not build , but \\u2018hello: hello . cpp\\u2019 do build . looking into the \\u2018make -p\\u2019 output , i note this difference: the rule for making hello . x is \\'hello . x: hello . cpp\\u2019 , as for hello it is: \\'hello: hello . cpp hello . cpp\\u2019 . anyone who understands why ? .. having written the question and done the substitute , i do understand why . i have some positive response for oslo event in april . i have . one 45 min slot to fill , any ideas on an attractive and simple module . this is more seminar type than teaching . one idea is to talk about reproducibility in research software , or data , or both . that\\u2019s quite ambitious for 45 min ? maybe best practices or a view from high above (it\\u2019s so easy to get drowned in all the technical details) ? or a fun module \\u2026 biggest personal pitfalls/mistakes with the invitation to talk about own mistakes ? we will have an intro to coderefinery in the morning where we give high level overview of things we care about in the project . the biggest personal pitfalls sounds interesting . for sure we don\\'t want to go into any tech details during a 45 min session . who here is using or has used gitlab (<http://gitlab . com|gitlab . com> or custom gitlab instance) ? <@u23htrtjt> @vathasav i recommend that you tell your real names to github so that there is no doubt who these user names are (i know it now but others might not) . sorry wrong handle , i meant <@u2b3dh142> . odd , i thought i had . user \"baileqi\" turned out to be <@u2l0js68k> . yes , i added my first and last name to github so hopefully it will be less confusing :slightly_smiling_face: . now it is fine , thanks for that lukasz - for some time i was worried that i gave somebody access by accident . i am using a custom gitlab instance . about gitlab: i would like us to start working on the ci part - we 99% know it will be gitlab based so we can already start working on it even before we have our own gitlab up - i would like us (tentatively looking at <@u2b3dh142> and <@u21p57pkr>) to hook up one small test machine/vm/instance \"somewhere\" in the neic or csc cloud and configure it as test runner for <http://gitlab . com|gitlab . com> (later we would use it with our own instance) - i have a colleague here in tromso who could field-test it and provide feedback and fine tuning - the aim would be a setup where we can connect instances to gitlab ci and we would start with just one . do you think this is possible and easy ? if having a little test instance running somewhere is a financial issue , then please let me know and i will try to convince the people who decide this . it should be possible but don\\u2019t know how easy it is . we can also use docker , kubernetes to configure as runners . we could start looking into it . i think it would be good if you two start looking into this so that we gather experience (you have to say stop if i ask for too much) . the goal is not to have a super perfect scaling setup but something that works and something that we could start with . who here knows his or her way around css ? you mean the width-bug ? <@u2b3dh142>: i actually am running a gitlab instance in our cloud . i can fix it today or tomorrow . thanks <@u23htrtjt> , yes the width thing , thank you . <@u2b3dh142>: docker or similar setup is ok too . i ran into at least one issue with gitlab + cloud , we should see into that . for the ci: we will probably not offer this to everybody in the nordics , too expensive - we will most probably offer it to some use cases and document how to set up own instances , this means that we don\\'t need a very general auth solution but can work with ad hoc tokens or something like that . <@u2b3dh142>: and if we use docker , we still need to decide on where we store the data etc . and further on , backups etc . for the ci , in many cases a shared platform can\\'t be used anyway . good point , i also did not think about backups but people will probably want to keep logs of the test runs somewhere . there are many issues we have to decide on , including availability targets etc . and that is balancing between trustworthiness and price . trustworthiness here contains many things . i\\'m just a lazy writer . :slightly_smiling_face: in few more keywords , what do you consider under trustworthiness ? is it uptime ? wait time ? availability (this i guess includes uptime too) , response time , backup frequency ... ok so imo we don\\'t need very good availability to start , response time should not be more than few minutes , backup frequency is not very important as a start and uptime does not have to be more than 95% to start with . in other words , if we offer something that is workable , people will be happy - imo we should not strive to offer google-level availability . i would like to start with something ok-ish and later grow it and improve . i would like us to start with a \"minimum viable product\" :slightly_smiling_face: . on a totally unrelated topic , i spoke to my colleague about his designer friend who helped him make a really cool poster , and she (the designer) is willing to create a professional looking logo for us . she would create a few suggestions , based on our directions . it would cost on the order of 500\\u20ac . but maybe the logo is not worth or even possible to spend that amount of money on ? why dont the members come up with some logos ( i know there is already one idea) . if you do not want to use a software do ot on papper , if we failed to comup with anything then its worth pending money . ok so if we can come up with something , that is always welcome (constraint from me is that the logo should not have too many details so that it makes sense also as twitter icon or github icon and that it is sticker-friendly) . a good logo is worth 500 eur imo but sadly i am not in a position to write such a check without first consulting with money givers . here are two logos for previous project\\'s with help off colegues . <https://goo . gl/images/httdpd> . <https://goo . gl/images/3xrzgy> . minimum viable product sounds good . later on iterate , if more is needed . thanks for sharing this sabry ! thor , can you share some of her previous logo work with us ? yes , i\\u2019ll contact her . i think the price is otherwise fair (but i need to consult this with the steering group) , professional logo design is not for free . <https://twitter . com/coderefine/status/829697434234261504> . <https://www . linkedin . com/company-beta/10953141/> . if the ones using linkedin could \"like\" and \"tweet\" and whatever :slightly_smiling_face: . first request for participating in the mailing list arrived .. great ! will be interesting to see if this gains traction . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i changed the first 30 minutes to go a long with make and ending up with a motivation for cmake . take a look and disagree if you believe it will not work , <https://github . com/blindij/cmake/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/02-hello-world . md> . thanks ! very good ! i think this will work . i would add a motivation for why we use make instead of just building things on the command line [*] , the example from the trenches is good but i am skeptical that we will have time and knowhow to actually rewrite it (also it is then impossible to test) but i would keep the part where we look at it and discuss issues and then naturally introduce cmake . [*] today i looked at a code project with many fortran files instead of one (good) , but to avoid writing make files , the person just included the other 20 fortran files into one main fortran file . this means that he fixes one typo in the code and the entire code needs to be recompiled every single time . as to the mailing list , it is always scary to be the first one writing to it - hopefully somebody has the courage - when you get any code development related questions , direct people there so that we get some activity . tomorrow (fri) deadline for install instructions (bj\\xf8rn you need to add clang if it is not there yet) . all the coderefinery team needs to join the mailing list (if you are not part of it already): <https://groups . google . com/group/coderefinery> so that you get notified if people ask questions . for the git intro . is it ok if change the xame . what is xame ? typo , i meant example . in my opinion: yes . i recommend to fork , change , file pull request , demonstrate the new code and discuss it , alternatively open an issue , suggest the change , discuss it there , then implement it . all trivial changes can imo go directly . if you have any doubt about changes , discuss them over issues or pull requests . <@u2k0egsc8> <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u2234ay5a> are you planning to add/change something in the installation instructions ? no , i will not use clang . hey , yes , probably on monday ... can we wait ? i have no . changes . my changes are for content . we\\'ll talk with pinja and after that things will be more clear . i have an open issue on the git lesson , comments welcome . <https://github . com/coderefinery/git-intro/issues/4> . <@u2k0z6mdg> i also wanted to split the lesson into something with repository 1 that is done to demo and similar steps to be done on repository 2 in exercises immediately thereafter . <@u0kv7fvnv> i fixed the face images . i found an interesting option that starts taking pixels from the sides to make the image fit , which looks pretty neat as faces are usually in the center of the image . <@u23htrtjt> , 2 repos , then i need to say about conflicts . if they have a common upstream you do . if they don\\'t you don\\'t really need to . thanks jyry ! we have our first post to the mailing list ! can someone well versed with ansible give any feedback ? thanks thor ! good stuff ! as a side idea: send mail to everyone , who has attended/plan to attend our events and advertise the @google group . and social media as well ... good idea , i\\u2019ll email to all the stockholm participants . probably best to do it together with an email on monday to remind about the installation , so that we don\\u2019t send too many emails . remember the social media too ... i agree with minimizing emails , i will write to espoo participants . <@u0kv7fvnv> yeah i think she\\u2019s pretty good . we would send her some specifications and she want draft a few suggestions . before our meeting tomorrow (monday) please test this registration form: <https://radovan . typeform . com/to/l3nro0> - during the meeting we will discuss what needs to be changed before we open it to register people for the copenhagen workshop . please document your observations/suggestions in the meeting agenda for tomorrow , thank you ! about the operating systems , should we specify linux distros ? especially because the package manager differ , the installation instructions may differ too . good morning ! did some shopping and visited some friends during the weekend . i agree with pinja . it is good to ask about linux distribution . for example , installing python3 is not straightforward in many distributions . binary arithmetic , boolean algebra - is there truly a better way of spending the wknd ? <@u2b3dh142> , on the other hand , installing some *conda package solves many of these troubles . my weekend: taking our new garage into use . no , we don\\'t have a car . yes , we need a garage to store our bikes and other sports equipment . today: back pain . <@u2234ay5a> what if someone is using only cli , i . e .. from vm ? probably , we may not encounter that issue . i was snowboarding on saturday , learning golang and doing some paperwork on sunday . we are hosting two students for a week . one is from mexico and the other from chile . they are attending the international student festival in trondheim , <https://www . isfit . org> . the festival program is pretty packed so we do not seem them very much , other than for breakfast . so i start the day with a discussion about trump , international politics and explaining norwegian customs and food . <@u0kv7fvnv>: is it possible to join <https://groups . google . com/forum/# ! forum/coderefinery> with my @csc . fi adress rather than my @gmail . com address ? i use the latter mainly for non-work stuff , and would like to keep it that way , and keep work related things to my csc address . (the \"apply for membership\" seems to assume i want to use the gmail address , and won\\'t let me change it) . i understand the problem - it is possible to join a google group with a non-google email but i don\\'t know how the system behaves if you already have a google email , this is the clear downside of google groups . it\\'s not ideal to entangle work email and non-work email - i am open to moving away from google groups but then need suggestions . <@u0kv7fvnv>: ok , i\\'ll use the gmail address for now . there seems to be a possibility to set up a email-forwarding filetr on gmail , that may solve the problem . it is definitely possible to add alternative emails to your google account and write from them , to avoid exposing your google one when posting - but also this entangles things a bit but at least you do not expose your google email . good morning ! i did some more skating on a lake this weekend . the conditions were perfect , sun , cold , no snow and smooth ice . did some skating as well yesterday - 5 . 5 hours in sunshine and a few minus degrees . the ice was perfect in some places , and awful elsewhere . this page lists what you can do without a google account , and also mentions that you can add a secondary address to a google account and use that one in a mailinglist . <https://support . google . com/groups/answer/1067205 ? hl=en&amp;visit_id=1-636225733509031679-2479253165&amp;rd=1#join> . ktwikfeldt: thanks . looks like an (even) better solution than the forwarding filter solution . <@u21ph491q> , the installation instructions: a) . the ide (pycharm) part is ok b) . the devops part can be taken away (vagrant) this time , is because of time limits it will be mostly talk and little show session . <@u21ph491q> please confirm receival . <@u2234ay5a> ok , i\\u2019ll remove the vagrant part and leave ide part as it is . thnx . everybody , is this acceptable: <http://coderefinery . org/registration/> ? - previously i was sending out automatic emails but this now bugs for a reason that i don\\'t understand but perhaps we can do without . link to this page shows up under the registration button . looks good , but could you perhaps add section headers , since otherwise people might not read it carefully (or at all) . for example \\u201cconfirmation email\\u201d , \\u201cwaiting list\\u201d , \\u201cfirst come , first serve\\u201d , \\u201ccancellation\" . good point , will add it . what\\u2019s the best recommendation to students for push . default , current ? i think so that is safe and imo intuitive . this is what i use . registration for copenhagen workshop is open: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-05-09-copenhagen/> - i will post a tweet in a moment . contents copied for linkedin: <https://www . linkedin . com/company-beta/10953141/> . just to remind that this can be added to customer em@ails and \"liked\" by < ! channel> too ... seems , i do not have permission to neicweb repo , i have forked it and there is a pending pull request . thanks , i will accept it in a moment . idea for the ci: jenkins as a service , bonus: repo platform-independent . shall i add this google map of lunch restaurants to the stockholm workshop website ? <https://drive . google . com/open ? id=1ruc5rowm-p7ceeegd4ltmvqywvi&amp;usp=sharing> . it seems that i don\\'t have access to it , but yeah :slightly_smiling_face: . good morning ! i\\u2019ve written another news article to be published on the pdc website . this one is about our first workshop in espoo , and we can use it to further advertise our activities . i placed the document in coderefinery/outreach/coderefinery_espoo_newsarticle . it would be great to get comments and feedback . perfect - thank you ! one thing i forgot: do we want the participants to somehow present themselves ? if yes , how ? i am a bit skeptical about the traditional \"we go around the room and everybody says who they are and what they do\" because in my experience that is something for the ultra short memory . here is what a colleague of mine does: people tell to their neighbor in one sentence what they do and tell one thing that they did which they are really proud of - bonus: people talk to their neighbors and warm up , downside: only the neighbors know . we can also let people write something about them on the google doc or etherpad . also i would like us to say a bit more who we are and how we came into programming and computing so that people can hopefully better relate - i would like us to create a setting where we all discuss at the same level and avoid that people think that we think we know everything . what\\'s your opinion ? how should we let people introduce themselves ? i think that it is good if people learn to know each other and talk during coffee breaks . this actually worked pretty well in espoo although we did not manage this . yeah it\\u2019s a good question . i\\u2019m not sure about the talking-to-your-neighbor , better i think to have all-to-all somehow . i agree , would be nice if everybody knows who is in the room without making it ultra boring . and i\\u2019m not sure if there\\u2019s anything much better than just introducing yourself . my experience is that you remember a few at least , and that can lead to a conversation in a coffee break . but maybe asking people to write a sentence or two in a google doc is worth a try . is it ultraboring if everyone one by one introduces themselves ? another question , i\\u2019m going to create the name badges . should we have something else than names on them ? like \\u201ccoderefinery stockholm\\u201d or something . ok let\\'s do normal intro - i guess this is useful , let\\'s keep it simple . what i personally like is if people draw their own badges , it is simpler for us and more artistic freedom for the people - but it is ok to have regular professional name badges . aha , yeah i agree it\\u2019s more fun if everyone draws their own . i\\u2019ll just cut paper into badge-size pieces then , saves a lot of work . exactly . <@u2k0z6mdg> the lecture room has only one projector and isn\\u2019t equipped for another one , i . e . there\\u2019s no second white screen nor rail-thing to attach another screen . but maybe the whiteboard can be used to project on if it\\u2019s important . we have no shortage on post-it notes , right ? <@u21ph491q> thanks for cheking . tomorrow deadline for adding yourself to this page: <https://neic . nordforsk . org/about/team/coderefinery/> - latest meeting minutes describe how . no i think i have enough after emptying the cupboards at pdc , but just in case ill pick up some more at wherever they\\u2019re kept . <@u2k0egsc8> we\\u2019ve had one windows user for next week\\u2019s workshop who couldn\\u2019t get the make installation to work . it complained that msys-1 . 0 . dll was missing . she managed to install another make successfully though from <http://gnuwin32 . sourceforge . net/install . html> (gnu make 3 . 81) . maybe good to add to installation instructions for future workshops as a backup solution . i\\u2019ll look at it - probably a good idea as you say . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i have offered sintef a coderefinery session in may , probably in parallel with the copenhagen workshop . i am thinking of conducting it myself over two days . ok , of course i would love to be part of it but if it is parallel to the workshop in copenhagen , then i cannot :slightly_smiling_face: . running two days by yourself is tough - any chance to move the dates ? speaking of which i am planning for our june meeting in tromso but need to wait few days to get info from colleagues here to avoid collision with other events . the sintef-dates are not settled . we could make it fit your schedule if you want to come along . i would like to be there - it would be easier for you if we share the workload and it would help me to meet more developers and get input and feedback , dates in may that are not too close to the cph workshop or neic 2017 are still fine - we could also add a day or two where we sit in one place and prepare the neic 2017 workshop . possibly stupid question: is sintef academia or industry ? in other words are we \"allowed\" to offer them a workshop ? not stupid question: sintef is a set of research institutes . in some respects they are industry , in other contexts they are academia . for this , we should regard them as academia . i was also thinking of just jusing the coderefinery sessions , and not involve to many of the coderefinery project , since it will be a closed session and \\u201ccloser to industry\\u201d . hence , be the tough guy , and conducting it myself :slightly_smiling_face::slightly_smiling_face: . personally i think it would be good to involve them since they are very visible in norway and possibly a good resource for input . i think i will double check with the steering group whether it is ok for me to use travel/hotel/worktime money for this but it is definitely fine to use our material thanks to cc-by (sometimes wondering whether we should rather have cc-by-sa) . i can ask sintef to cover your travel&amp;&amp;hotel . eventually i would also like to involve the simula lab ... one thing we are discussing in the <#c096enk7s|xt> channel is to set up a reference group for this project - this is a group that gives input and feedback and criticism but does not steer (directly) - we are currently weak on third-party feedback for what we do and key people in key institutions and universities could be the right people to give us this feedback , currently we cannot really quote anybody that what we do is good or needed apart from workshop attendants feedback - we will need this feedback loop for the infrastructure - of course we do what we think is the right thing to do but we may miss the target . i see the point with a reference group . meeting researchers from sintef could be a good thing . i think so too . i also have some contacts there and i have also seen some source code that could need some input from us diplomatically speaking . .. really ? :face_with_rolling_eyes: . today i finally start updating my material , was bogged down with other tasks , many commits coming up the following 5 days . yesterday , i learned how the time scheduled were set . i\\u2019ll commit those changes , so that we announce that we start at 09:00 on wednesday . homework for everybody: read about the r language , it is again the second most popular language at the stockholm workshop and we need to be able to relate - i am reading this: <http://swcarpentry . github . io/r-novice-inflammation/> . we don\\'t need to be experts but we need to be able to show them few examples in our talks . would be good to relate to r-folks also in the jupyter and ide session <@u21ph491q> <@u2234ay5a> (possibly it is already the case , did not check yet latest state of the material) . i have some stuff on r actually . super ! (i will give you feedback but i am also running behind my own stuff) . will take a look into rstudio then . someday ... a notice ... <https://coderefinery . github . io/installation/linux/> seems we are having only the latest version of installation instructions published . would be nice to somehow version them and tie to the particular workshop , as sessions vary . versioning sources \\u2026 are you crazy :wink: . actually publishing versions \\u2026 it was just too tempting \\u2026 i\\u2019m sure you have all sources properly versioned . i was thinking about it but felt it was overkill and that nobody would like to have outdated install doc but i think you have a point , if we move things around or phase modules out they could be harder to reproduce - it is easy for us to add the install stuff to our museum . or if we think of the reusal of the session materials , then might be good to attach instruction to lesson . yes i like this idea , it makes it easier to see which install instructions you own (are responsible for) . it also makes it obvious which installation is needed for which session . <@u2k0egsc8> sorry still did not manage to do my cmake work but tomorrow is the day when miracles will happen :slightly_smiling_face: don\\'t worry it will all work fine and it will be a great session . what is the best way to get to course location from arn . for the airport-city route you can choose between the express train (which is fast , 20 minutes , but quite expensive , 280 sek) , or the flybus <http://www . flygbussarna . se|www . flygbussarna . se> . what time are you arriving ? for the city-center - kth uni route , there\\u2019s a subway . red line north towards m\\xf6rby centrum (that\\u2019s the final destination) . you get off at tekniska h\\xf6gskola , and take the exit from the station in the backwards direction (relative to the train) . landing 15:20 . sunday . this is for our gitlab/ci experts <@u2k0egsc8> <@u2l0js68k> <@u2234ay5a> <@u2b3dh142> <@u23htrtjt> <@u21p57pkr> - the next coderefinery steering group meeting is march 9 , in other words 3 weeks from now . by that time we need to have a good idea of what we want , what we need and what we miss - if we want to buy services (e . g . from csc or external) , the steering group meeting is the time for me to ask the funding members to agree or disagree so i kindly ask you to prepare few options that we can present them - please involve me if you get stuck or hit any obstacles - thank you and keep it up and have a good weekend ! today <@u21ph491q> and me participated in an interview for an article about the project , i think it went very well , kudos to thor for participating and for preparing me for it - :thumbsup: . <@u21ph491q> sorry not sure anymore: we/you asked people to set up github account and gitconfig , right ? also we should let those know who are left on the waiting list (perhaps that has been done , sorry lost a bit track over emails) . <@u2k0z6mdg> when you show git diff (if you show it) , i suggest to also show it in combination with a visual diff tool . all see <#c050v61rb|general> - opportunity to participate in a pps course given in english , shaped for neic setting , it\\'s about the management model used within neic , good for you if you want to manage your own project and good for your cv if you are interested in project management . <@u0kv7fvnv> sorry late reply . i just added the github account and gitconfig stuff to the installation instructions , not in an email to the students . were you thinking of something different ? <@u0kv7fvnv> , i do not use visual tools , do you have anything interesting that i could show . abd yes i will diff . thanks thor i think this will do . <@u2k0z6mdg> please install e . g . meld and when you show git diff , please also show git difftool (same syntax and same behavior) which will open the diff in a visual diff program where you can compare left/right instead of + and - , this is useful for more extensive diffs . let me try . i use it to weed out debug prints that i would otherwise forget in the code . also when you discuss diffs , please explain that a diff is always with respect to last staged change (this is often surprising for git beginners) , you can then also mention or show how to diff wrt last committed state or between committed and staged . in meld you can remove entire code blocks by holding shift and clicking on the \"x\" , very useful . git difftool (and git mergetool for conflict resolution) can work with any visual diffing tool , meld is just one of many . for people who do reject guis , there is e . g . vimdiff - often left-right diffs are easier to see than top/bottom +/- diffs . i will make one change to the workshop schedule: move documentation on wednesday from morning to afternoon , we will need the morning for cmake and i believe we have enough time in the afternoon . ok . <@u21ph491q> <@u2k0z6mdg> here we might need to move the coffee break to 10:30 <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-intro/> . i am not sure when exactly the coffee arrives . it arrives 10:15 . i said 10:30 to the catering firm , and they assumed that\\u2019s when the break would be , so decided to deliver at 10:15 . ok so we need to move the break to earlier in the git-intro . i will add an issue . <@u0kv7fvnv>: ack . <@u2234ay5a> <@u2k0egsc8> my plan is to leave the hotel tomorrow 7:40 - our plan is to be at the course location 8:30 <@u2k0z6mdg> . we will probably arrive a bit earlier but it\\'s good to have some margin . hey , i\\'ll try to get by 8 . 15 . ok . shall we meet by the intrance of the building ? or do you prefer a meeting place easier to find , like simply the exit of the subway station ? i\\'ll be ready at 0740 . i walk to the venue , so it could be the entrance at some point in time . we could meet at the library cafeteria (not sure it is open at that time) . i can come earlier if good coffee is promised) . the library cafeteria has very good coffee: apparently opens 8:00 , bottom of this page: <http://storiescafe . se/hitta-oss . html> . the library opens at 8:00 , but the cafe inside not until 9 . ah ok too bad . what we could do is meet there first and then go to pdc next door and grab a cafe-quality espresso/capucchino/whatever . shall we say meet outside the library at 8:20 ? sounds good ! library is almost impossible to miss if you walk up from the metro towards kth campus , it will be on your left side . as long as you make sure to walk \\u201cstraight up\\u201d the slope , not turn weak left or 90 degrees right . here is practical info for tomorrow: <http://bit . ly/coderefinery-stockholm> (please add points if i forgot something) . good morning everyone . have a nice workshop :slightly_smiling_face: . did someone arrived already ? i did ! we are at the library having coffee . we might need some extra electricity extenders . cool . ok good point . thor will get those . . is there any good takeaway coffee :-( . ? at z cafeteria ? ;-) . 3 ppl are here already . water&amp;/glasses we might also like . someone needs to be on site and meet/guide/host ppl about half an hour before the announced start . those of you who are at the workshop , i have created a file called \"lessons-learned\" in the stockholm workshop folder where we can record own observations and improvements before we forget them . <@u0kv7fvnv> can u approximate the ending time of managing complexity and modular code development (radovan) . <@u0kv7fvnv> is it ok if i take a picture of the class from behind and share to linkedin ? no faces than sabry\\'s :-) . yes let\\'s take photos . my session will end latest at 3 pn . thnx . <https://www . linkedin . com/company-beta/10953141/> . what is the address for the feedback file at gdocs for participants ? i\\u2019ve written down all the feedback to the git intro session in the stockholm workshop folder in the file feedback . thanks ! is anyone still in the lecture room ? i forgot to bring the feedback from the last session , was planning to type it up ... i have the feedback , i am in the library cafeteria . ok ill come there in a bit . one suggestion for dinner: ramen ki-mama , birger jarlsgatan , if you are into ramen , their food is better than their website: <http://kimamma . se/> . czech food: <http://svejk . se/en/> . brilliant place but not super cheap and maybe difficult to get seats: <http://www . tranan . se/> . all seems to be fine yet different . ramen is really spectacular and not expensive but small place and might be closed , website is not helpful - i suggest we meet at the ramen place , it\\'s hopefully not too far from your hotels and then we can go to some other place if it is not what we want or closed , ok ? 7 pm ? i prefer a less expensive place . ok meet at 19:00 . ok let\\'s meet there , birger jarlsgatan 93 . okey , thank you . magnus , one of my colleagues from tromso will join (who happens to be in stockholm at the same time) . <@u21ph491q> do you prefer to start the afternoon or end the afternoon with jupyter ? i think both can make sense and i would like you to choose what you think is better for you and globally better . also can somebody who knows ansible et al . better than me please answer the question on our mailing list ? best commercial for a mailing list is when people see that their questions get answered . bjoern and i are in the library . <@u21ph491q> if you stop by pdc can you please get a new set of whiteboard pens ? . will do . i\\'ll be a few minutes late . my daughter wasn\\'t cooperating this morning ... . <@u0kv7fvnv> i\\'ll answer but i\\'m afraid the answer isn\\'t going to be all vanilla . bast: sorry missed your question , yes i can go first this afternoon . <@u2k0z6mdg>: the bash magic you showed yesterday to show the current branch automatically in the command prompt; where do i find the documentation for that ? <@u0a9nv7px> i do not remember the source , google for bow to set __git_ps1 if you did get any good details , let me know . <@u0a9nv7px> not sure if sabry uses the same one but <https://github . com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt> . @ceala there should be an easier way , let me have a look . <@u0a9nv7px> you can try this and get loot of goodies <http://ohmyz . sh/> . +1 from a zsh fan . thanks a lot <@u23htrtjt> for a very good answer . <@u21ph491q> <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u2234ay5a> <@u2k0egsc8> thank you ! fantastic work . i think we made a splash . write down your thoughts while they are fresh , we will talk about them on monday . i will update the feedback tonight or tomorrow . also got good feedback over email and twitter: <https://twitter . com/coderefine> . very good feedback on ide session ! i am now going through the papers and typing it in ... the feedback is overall very good ! there\\'s some good materia in those slides that rasmus \\xe5gren shared . leads to at least one new idea , should we include something on package managers in future workshops ? i have now typed up all feedback . as to package management: very language specific , but would help reproducibility - good idea but difficult to pull off , but what we could easily have is a good practice guide . for me the most urgent next lesson in line is how to share and consume software from the license point of view and open source versus closed source - we also need to consolidate and harmonize what we have already , we still have a huge disagreement between planned times and real times and we can harmonize better sessions among themselves . i agree , we have to be more disciplined with the timing , and try to create better alignment between topics . <@u0kv7fvnv> , did you have a chance to ask caela about spending money on a logo ? yes i will write her and p\\xe5l and kine an email now . i recommend you use the \"invest\" instead of \"spend\" :slightly_smiling_face: . thanks ! good point . hi all , in order to get the graphics designer started on our logo we should provide her with some ideas . can we set ourselves a weekend task of finding logos/pictures/themes that we like (or sketching something ourselves) which can be gathered and discussed on monday ? yes ! i will draft the agenda in a minute and add this to the agenda - what i would like us now to do more and more is that we all pre-fill the agenda , i would like this to be more collaborative . <@u21ph491q> i love the idea of this but have no idea how to logofy it <https://en . wikipedia . org/wiki/oil_refinery#/media/file:refineryflow . png> . <@u23htrtjt> i was thinking of something similar ! i find something along these lines quite appealing: <https://image . shutterstock . com/z/stock-vector-industry-icon-showing-a-factory-or-petrochemical-refinery-plant-logo-with-chimneys-belching-smoke-184655813 . jpg> . i like the flames , excess code should burn . :slightly_smiling_face: . a google image search on \\u201crefinery logo\\u201d shows a lot of cool designs (but i\\u2019m not sure how google personalizes image search results) . i have added some stuff to the meeting agenda , please feel free to add stuff there too . guys , if absolutely must picture chemistry , select something more useful\\u2026eh tasteful , i mean , <http://www . nabreweries . com/images/slides/slide6 . jpg> . yeah , maybe the project should have been called codebrewery ... alternative name was codestillery actually - i have also bought <http://codestillery . org|codestillery . org> - try it ! \"code that is free as in beer\" etc . i was asked to write a blog post about what coderefinery is to the csc blog ages ago . now that we don\\'t have any registrations for finnish workshops coming any time soon i thought i\\'d give the post to our marketing and communications team to publish when they feel like . comments are welcome <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1whcjbaqmbbq5ponqyny5k4sivosgcemvbqyz3w6nu28/edit ? usp=sharing> . great post , i like the red queen analogy . indeed ! great post . the spring is coming ! so we\\'ve been planting herbs and tomatoes for seedlings ... i thought about planting tomatoes , but last year a rabbit ate all my stuff so will probably skip everything this year . spring ? all i see outside the window is snow , ice and clouds ... <@u21ph491q> the best thing about alice in wonderland is that it\\'s old enough to be public domain :slightly_smiling_face: . ah , good point . it really is amazingly old . yet never \\u201cgrows old\" . btw <@u2234ay5a> , was your flight on wednesday on time ? nope , but the delay was not that substantial . i added a link with some gas/oil refinery logos which i find cool to the \\u201ccreate logo\\u201d trello card , along with a 8-bit masterpiece i just created . and meanwhile in iceland: <https://i . redd . it/slzf9ydyt8iy . gif> . wow , is that a land rise or increased snow depth ? iceland isnt rising , it\\u2019s splitting apart . so increased snow depth . overnight ! server maintenance , busy day . we got tons and tons of snow , was busy shoveling snow and shoveling myself out of the snow when snowboarding . dear all , please take some time to pre-fill today\\'s meeting agenda . moved jyry\\'s blog post to \"outreach\" folder . we had a folder with that name ? i must have missed it . yes :slightly_smiling_face: no problem . unless i funked up sharing permissions , let me know if you cannot see it . <@u0kv7fvnv> i asked seija , our resident r and statistics wizard and she might be persuaded to join in on at least one workshop . mind you she is an r and statistics person , not a coder person . very cool ! . i think it is perhaps even an advantage if seija is not a coder person because many r users in our workshops would rather identify with being a statistics person than a coder person . this is indeed a very good presentation: <https://drive . google . com/file/d/0b22xv97agrmesdn0uvo4tepyy0u/view ? usp=sharing> - we could do something like this instead of a high level devops overview . <@u21ph491q> do you have a suggestion for how we organize a vote on the logo ideas ? i can also write down what i would like but then it\\'s less democratic . maybe it\\u2019s best if everyone who has an opinion posts a link , a file or a description of a proposed logo on the trello card . we can have a deadline on , say , thursday , and we then have a look at the suggestions and send them all to the designer , or if they\\u2019re too many , vote here on slack on which ones to send . indeed a nice idea on how to do the devops session . as to logo: should we perhaps open a new google doc on that ? then one can add images and also text and later use that as basis to send to the designer - perhaps easier to move things around than on a trello card ? yes , much better idea . what do you think about this one: <https://m . signalvnoise . com/how-we-set-up-our-work-cbce3d3d9cae# . fbb9htfgf> . i have created a file \"logo-design\" in the main folder , please edit . i have swapped few sessions for the cph workshop: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-05-09-copenhagen/> - let me know if you see problems . should we increase the lunch break from 1h to 1:30 for the workshops ? it always felt a bit rushed but perhaps it\\'s just because we have to take care of many things . gitlab experts , can we have a meeting either on friday or monday where we talk about the different options that we have ? for my part i think 1h lunch break is fine , and increasing it to 1 . 5h would put further time pressure on our sessions . but i don\\u2019t know what the students thought . true , let\\'s keep 1h . friday at 11:00 will work for my part . one hour for lunch was fine . it is not good to put more time pressure on the lessons . super , also for me friday 11:00 is good - how is this time for <@u2l0js68k> <@u23htrtjt> <@u21p57pkr> <@u2b3dh142> <@u2234ay5a> (12:00 helsinki time) ? aim is that we all get on one page so that we are represented with one voice next week at the steering group meeting . fine for me . super - i have it in my calendar , we can meet at the usual place (hangouts) , please prepare a meeting document where we synthesize things . i\\'ll try to attend , but i have another meeting on friday at the same time . what time would be better for you pinja ? i\\'ll set up a doodle , that\\'s perhaps easlier . voila: <http://doodle . com/poll/2z5ne3vbn6xg4x45> . thanks for quick feedback on the doodle - to have everybody on board , let\\'s move the meeting on monday 12:00 cet , 13:00 eet (our usual time) - everybody welcome to join the meeting but the focus will be gitlab service and ci in preparation for the steering group meeting thursday next week . we have green light for the logo design . please take the time to accumulate all information before monday so that we minimize the things that we don\\'t know - let me know if you need help with that , in particular we need to know whether we can in principle use csc as partner or whether we better run ourselves or use paid hosting . <@u2b3dh142> should we go out hunting for stakeholders tomorrow ? sure ! more about gitlab: discussing with researchers i see that they are worried sending data over to the states and would very much welcome to have a service where the data remains in the nordics . <@u21ph491q> a keyword for the tentative stockholm-meetup could be \"mentoring\" , but of course we need to develop it further . <@u2l0js68k> have you also written to <http://cbiovikings . org> ? can you in the contact document mark those contacts that have been contacted ? just to avoid any doubts . thank you . feedback i got now over email: \"the course was really useful for me , i am so glad i got the opportunity to participate . i have already told most of the phd students at my department about how useful the course is and that they have to attend your course the next time it is given , so hopefully you will get a lot pf applications from meteorologist for the next course . \" . hey , what do u think of adding anonymized general feedback to the homepage ? i am worried about vandalism . later we should have blogs and then i would also like to have some discussion option . <@u21ph491q> alternative idea for a one-day or half-day meetup: we organize a meeting where we invite people to give talks about a certain theme like reproducible science or whatever and then also give people possibility to mingle and get advice , yet another idea is that we organize a lightweight mini conference (but this would need more time for planning) . thanks for the ideas <@u0kv7fvnv> . we\\u2019re already going to have a mini-conference in connection to the pdc pub on may 19 , and there\\u2019s definitely overlap between possible attendants for coderefinery and pdc events . so some sort of meeting sounds better . all: let\\'s plan the tromso workshop: <http://doodle . com/poll/tr7696kt5df4b54b> (ideally i want 4 days: 3 workshop days and 1 extra team day) . <@u0kv7fvnv>: june 26-30 there will be a nordugrid conference in tromso , with some seasoned developers coming :slightly_smiling_face: . actually , 27-30 , monday is for getting there . thanks i will try to make it fit but depends on a number of boundary conditions . free (beer and speech) git repo hosting based on gogs: <https://notabug . org> . i have a gitlab ci runner for test purpose . i have tested it with a docker executor and is working fine . if someone want to test it let me know . super ! yes i would like to test it . do you have access to any gitlab instance ? in the runner we have to register the gitlab uri and token for communicating with the gitlab instance . i will open a private chat to not flood the channel with setup info . brilliant ! works ! we have 6 registrations for copenhagen . <@u0kv7fvnv> , what sort of mailing lists do you use to announce ? i see the google group post . normally we have used country-specific mailing lists - but no problem to announce over our mailing list i think and also twitter . <@u2k0z6mdg> , is online . thor checking in . good morning ! morning , did you know , that since vaadin 8 ., all the components are now \"setimmediate\" by default ? it was an interesting weather to bike to work . technically it\\'s quite cold (-8 and windy) but the sun is shining . i couldn\\'t decide if i should feel cold . good morning , a bit warmer in trondheim , (-4c) but a cold wind from the south . nice conditions for being at the office , looking out to a sunny but cold day . obnoxious = extremely unpleasant , especially in a way that offends people . beautiful weather currently in tromso: snow , below zero , lots of sun - speaking of which: please do not forget to fill the doodle poll , also we meet today 12:00 cet/13:00 eet to talk about git repo and ci in preparation of the steering group meeting later this week . good morning ! it is getting cold again in finland ! any idea how to shut slackbot ? agree - i don\\'t know , i will ask in <#c0mtddd27|web> . it\\u2019s around zero here in stockholm and quite windy . it\\u2019s the time of the year where i finally get a bit tired of cold and start envying people in countries where the spring has actually arrived ... here spring is still 2 months away but very soon we will have more light than the south . for the may meeting in stockholm , i created a new directory under coderefinery / workshops / stockholm-2017-may . it currently has a draft of an announcement , which loosely defines my current idea of the meeting format , and a document with ideas . would be great to have your feedback . i will be in a meeting until 11:30 , will check back later . regarding the logo . shall we go ahead and send the ideas that we have now in the shared logo-design document to the designer ? i will make an iteration on the design document , everybody is of course welcome to edit but we need to structure it a bit better before sending it out , then we can also expect a better result . do we have meeting now . hi , sorry i\\'m late . yes the meeting is on . link to hangouts ? <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/sn7rt3wmgvcxhn363xj3owg4iue> . thanks <@u21ph491q> for preparing the document . we should decide a date for the stockholm may event . for me 24th would be good . i am now working on the design document for the logo (thanks thor and others for your work on this) - is it ok if i remove the coal processing \"mountain\" ? i don\\'t think this would be recognizable on small icons . but thank you for the suggestion . also i would like to remove the explicit example of 8-bit art to not overspecify it but to give some room for the designer but i will mention in the document that imo any of the ideas are compatible with 8-bit pixely versions . who apart from radovan wants to attend , and are there constraints on dates . sounds good <@u0kv7fvnv> . it is a \\u201ckullmile\\u201d - early chemistry through out the nordic countries ... <@u2k0egsc8> i like the idea but it requires lots of detail to be recognized i think . .. no problems with removal . :slightly_smiling_face: . and when minified it could easily look like a shitpile :slightly_smiling_face: that\\'s my worry . <@u21ph491q> may 24th is still free in my calendar . it has to be recognizable at the size of the avatars left of the chat text here . let\\u2019s preliminarily book may 24 then . i will now block it in the calendar . and what about having it in the afternoon , from 13-17 ? i think a whole-day event is too much . i also think that half-day is a good start . from my perspective the logo design document is now ready to go . <@u0kv7fvnv> , how are yiu going to communicate the idea to the designer . thor will send the document but i think it would be good if i could talk to the person over hangouts as well to explain a bit what we do and what we want . i\\'ll introduce <@u0kv7fvnv> to the designer when i send the email so you can arrange a meeting . have you decided on the color . no i haven\\'t - ideas welcome but i also wanted to not restrict the designer too much . don\\'t think we\\'ve even discussed colour . beter to go with neic colors or nordic flag colors . or pink . pink is a joke by the way . neic colors are a possibility - but i am worried to overspecify the logo which would not leave any room for their creative process - generally nordic context is good if we manage to express it without overloading the logo . i am aiming at tromso workshop jun 20-22 (tue-thu) with possible extra days for group work and a hike - objections ? (sorry nordugrid - it is difficult for me to align without losing teachers and going into the weekend) . thanks again for good meeting about git(lab) yesterday - i will present all options to the steering group but after sleeping over it i am personally leaning towards deploying it on our servers with <@u23htrtjt> <@u2b3dh142> and <@u2l0js68k> maintaining the service with me as backup - we would learn more , had more control , and big selling point is data staying in the nordics . <@u0kv7fvnv> personally i\\'m fine for the workshop dates but i might suggest group work and hike for before the workshop as some people might have midsummer plans . i agree with jyry , would be good if we could do the group work and hike before 20-22 june . otherwise the dates suit me fine . regarding colors on the logo , we probably shouldn\\'t put too many constraints on the design like radovan said , but when we get the first sketches we can think whether using nordic colors makes sense . this is what the nordita institute does in their logo: <https://en . wikipedia . org/wiki/nordic_institute_for_theoretical_physics#/media/file:nordita_logo . png> . so when exactly is midsommer (sorry for silly question but it\\'s different depending on country) ? nordita logo is an example of a very good logo - i like it . june 24 in finland . so june 23 - 25 will be a long weekend . ok thanks , i will try to move it to earlier in june - i am now traveling , hopefully more updates on that tomorrow or friday . in principle it could be week earlier , my problem is heavy travel schedule the two weeks prior to june 12 so i would like to have some air to catch up with stuff in office before jumping into the next workshop . <@u0kv7fvnv>: i wont\\'t join the sg meeting on thursday physically . gudmund wanted to contact you about it ... he has contacted me . it is pity that you cannot come but we will manage - wishing a quick recovery . i gave up on quick already , just to feel completely healthy again would do the trick . ;-) . regarding the stockholm get-together in may , does may 19 work for everyone who wants to attend ? it looks like i have to move another pdc event to may 24 . may 19 is good for me - bonus for me for keeping this event afternoon-only is that i could actually do it all in one day and avoid overnight travel . how about we do the tromso workshop june 14-16 with a midnight sun hike on june 16 ? <@u21ph491q> you haven\\'t sent the logo order yet , right ? no rush just checking that i did not lose the email . no i haven\\u2019t , is our document ready to be sent ? imo yes , but i would then like to talk to the person and walk him/her through it and explain few ideas in words . sorry actually perhaps we could wait until friday , perhaps i get some ideas/feedback at sg meeting tomorrow . ok , sounds reasonable to wait until after the sg meeting . thanks to those who wrote the good docs on vcs/ci - reminder to me to more often rtf(ine)d - very good material there for sg meeting tomorrow . oh f stands for fine , i never knew ! :-) . <@u050v61jr>: are you connected diretly or via the virtual room ? hi michaela , i downloaded the client . clients are just available for mac and windows , i get \"your operating system is not supported\" , and from the ip system i get line is busy when trying to connect to the direct ip or nothing at all when trying to connect to the virtual room . i should be asked for the room id , but i never am . so after an hour or so i gave up . sorry i did not see this - ironically while being hosted at nordunet i had zero network for the entire day (don\\'t understand why but of course i do not blame nordunet who did an awesome job hosting us for the sg meeting) . <@u23htrtjt> <@u2b3dh142> <@u21p57pkr> a heads up: tomorrow (fri) i need to create a requirements document for the gitlab server that we will submit to the infrastructure providers; i will draft it but will need your feedback on it ideally tomorrow - will take 15 min of your time . will do it . btw , jyry is on vacation . <@u0kv7fvnv> let me know if i could e any help . cool ! i will type something up as fast as possible and share it with you for review . i\\'m studying today , but will try to take a look . we will initially aim at running the gitlab in-house (probably either in norway or at csc) , later we may outsource to a commercial hosting . what i need to create today is a document where we write what we resources we need to run the gitlab instance: how much storage , how many cores , how much ram , on which cloud - this document will be then circulated and communicated to the right places and then we hopefully soon get the resources so i need help from you on the specs . i think at this point we should not worry too much about authentication/authorization , we can start by manually enabling users and we will adapt as we grow - we anyway do not have the resources to offer it to entire nordics from day one . <@u0kv7fvnv> , do you know about scm . uninett . yes , it is possible that we might partner with them , but independently we should write down what resources we need for the next 6 and next 12 months and then we will see how we make that happen . requirements as mentioned by gitlab - we could make use of it - <https://docs . gitlab . com/ce/install/requirements . html> . thanks ! my plan is to have a rough document up by 14:00 eet . please comment here: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1dumdbylwizzo9e6gb0iqbfqnowenwyle4plb57exb-o/edit> - do not be afraid to change things - my aim is 1000 users , 10 projects default limit per user . is the availability measured from working hours , not including weekends ? i was thinking overall , i will specify it more explicitly . please modify if you think resources are too high or too low . <@u2k0z6mdg> what is the \"hardware\"/cloud behind scm . uninett ? as we are talking about continousintegration , should we mention something about continuosdeployment as well . allowing few projects to use our resources for deployment as well . <@u0kv7fvnv> , sorry away on a skype meeting , i do not kniw details of scm , but i was introduced to it as part of new cluster set up . <@u0kv7fvnv> i can find out if you want . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i just check a repo i am working on 4334 python and xml files , 173 mb , my be it is better to request at least 1 gb per project . that will be 10 gb in total for projects , easier to have free space than ask for more in the middle of an agreement . as back up request is involved , asking for more latter might increase the cost more as well . in my opinion it is good to start with 100 mb . as people start using the service , we can increase the default size of the projects . if some projects really need huge space we can ask them to send a request . i have also added database connectivity under \"must have\" , this was from bitbucket point of view and please remove if not relevant . thanks for feedback , 1 gb/project as default is a lot of storage , we can enable such projects but not as default at the beginning . <@u0kv7fvnv> , <@u2b3dh142> , i take back the 1gb limit , i see that you are planning 1000 users x 10 projects = 10k projects . potentially , although i think that number of users is comparable to number of projects in reality . even if you give 100mb per user then it will be 100 gb . yes . so yes , 100 mb is the realistic limit . is repo = project . yes , a project is basically one repo , plus some issue tracking which does not take too much data . please double check my numbers , i need to send this today , also let me know what cloud specs we require . we can always grow later but it should be a reasonable estimate at least for the next 6 months . gitlab experts , what sort of database needed ?, should this be in the vm it self or connecting to datasbase-hotel sort of thing . i think we would need to maintain the database ourselves and it would be postgresql . gitlab uses postgresql or mysql for storing user data . gitlab installation options can take care of properly setting up the database and connecting to it . hi all . we\\u2019ve booked may 19 for the stockholm get-together event . let me know if you would like to attend . i will put it on monday\\'s agenda (will draft the agenda in a minute; again would welcome if we all pre-fill the agenda ahead of the meeting) . good morning , every one . rainy day here in trondheim . looks like we will have early spring . the snow is melting , also in the woods . heading for troms\\xf8 this week . good morning ! we had a beautiful weekend in stockholm , definitely felt like spring is around the corner . bj\\xf8rn will see mountains of snow in troms\\xf8 - beautiful morning here although the temperature is expected to go up which is always a bit scary . dear all , please pre-fill today\\'s agenda document . :slightly_smiling_face: . correction to what i said in the meeting: infrastructure might also materialize within deic , more info soon . i have a bit difficulties finding a room here in tromso jun 14-16 - is jun ~20-22~ 19-21 possible if you travel back on jun ~22~ 21 evening and we place the hike on the weekend before the workshop ? yes that\\u2019s fine by me , probably even a bit better . room-wise it is a lot better , the week before are exams and all good rooms are booked for exams . how does it compare wrt the doodle poll ? 19 - 21 ok for me . i made an initial draft of a typeform registration thingy for the stockholm event: <https://kthw . typeform . com/to/jgfpbz> feedback welcome . <@u21ph491q>: was i supposed to be at that one , i\\'ve already marked the day as \"no kindergarten\" day ... . looks cool with the background ! how did you do that ? in the topics to discuss , i would add \"open source development\" . troms\\xf8 workshop: doodle-wise is the same , please speak up if you don\\'t want it to be 19-21 . tomorrow noon i want to announce it at sigma2 meeting . <@u0kv7fvnv> there was \\u201cdesign\\u201d tab at top where i could choose background . the annoying thing about this typeform is that there are lot\\u2019s of cool features that aren\\u2019t available unless you pay ... <@u0a9nv7px> it would have been great if you could attend , but it\\u2019s not strictly necessary . i set the tromso workshop for jun 19-21 , a tiny risk is that i have an appointment at the hospital the week before and there is a risk that i might be out of business for few days . <https://neic . nordforsk . org/2017/03/15/better-software-leads-to-better-science . html> . i thought i\\u2019d make a new template for coderefinery meetings like the one in stockholm , so i copied workshop . html to meeting . html and made some changes . there\\u2019s a branch called kth-may-meeting in the <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> repo . however , i get an error i don\\u2019t understand: \"jekyll 3 . 2 . 1 | error: liquid syntax error (line 53): unknown tag \\u2018endfor\\u2019\" . if anyone can immediately see what the problem is i would be grateful . can you post a link to the actual line ? <https://github . com/coderefinery/coderefinery . org/blob/kth-may-meeting/_includes/meeting . html#l53> . the problem is that there is no endif . hmm , that simple ! thanks . i\\u2019d become blind ... i\\u2019m wondering how to list coderefinery members and the speaker . \\u201cinstructors\\u201d isn\\u2019t that appropriate , so i thought maybe \\u201cinvited participants\\u201d , but that\\u2019s a bit misleading as well . on the event website , that is . speakers and moderators ? speakers and organizers ? yeah something like that . tromso workshop will be jun 19-21 , i will announce asap . great ! <@u0kv7fvnv> ack . good conference , call for contributions now open , i plan to go: <http://rse . ac . uk/conf2017/calls/> . i would really like to go . do you think neic would pay for it ? im just wondering , pdc would probably agree to sponsor it . i will check . the event page for the stockholm may meeting is almost ready in the kth-may-meeting branch of <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> . any comments are welcome . i\\u2019d like to open the registration over the weekend . looks good ! <@u2k0z6mdg> please also link the oslo event on our workshops website . the website is up now . thank you ! i will put it out on twitter . good morning all , hope you had a good weekend . it\\u2019s been sunny but chilly in stockholm , so called \\u201cwindow weather\" . hey , what can be better than a relaxed weekend with family :slightly_smiling_face: . i\\'m feeling very refreshed too . i understand today is spring equinox so the light just keeps on coming . hi . good morning everybody - we got fresh snow over the weekend so some shoveling was needed . the logo designer started her work , in 1-2 weeks time we will get first drafts . i will have a virtual meeting with the steering group today and inquire about the status of the resources for vcs and ci . til: <http://blog . ibmjstart . net/2016/01/28/jupyter-notebooks-as-restful-microservices/> . this is certainly something to demonstrate as a cool feature in the jupyter session . iis there a meeting now . next meeting is 27 march . ok , received google calenders\\u200b invite . <@u0kv7fvnv> , do you have a meeting link ? yes , this is a steering group meeting: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/hqwgd5demk4zqgxiozbj32yaxma> . <@u2k0z6mdg> will you be able to link to the april workshop on our website ? <@u2b3dh142> have you thought more about whether you want to give the testing lecture in cph or whether i should rather do it ? <@u2234ay5a> i would kindly ask you to put all your coderefinery energy to update the ide lecture notes so that they can be read and understood also without being in the room - it would also be great to crystallize aspects that are general to ides , in other words not be too pycharm specific (but it is ok to use pycharm for the demo) . i will skip the reproducible environments for now . i will look at testing part this week and can update you next week if i am able to doit or delegate it to you . ok - let us decide this on monday , i also tend towards skipping reproducible environments in cph and give more time to git (but we will develop a repr env lecture for after summer) . <@u2k0egsc8> i have created an empty space for our mma lesson: <https://coderefinery . github . io/mma/> - not much there but it\\'s a start , let us start adding things to avoid panic in may . <@u0kv7fvnv> , ok i will link the oslo workshop . thank you ! the page is now a bit hard-coded for \"normal\" workshops - let me know if you hit troubles there . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i figured it out and as the change was minor i accepted my own pull request , hope that is ok . now the page is live . perfect - thank you ! tromso workshop announced: <https://twitter . com/coderefine> . 10 registrations in 1 hour . that would be a great kpi ! *g* :-) . it also helped that i know a lot of people here so i have pitched it to them directly and word-of-mouth seems to work . but at least two people will fly in from oslo and helsinki just for this course , hence my questions about the nordic travel grant . the nmep won\\'t cover in country travels so the person from oslo is out . <@u0kv7fvnv> did the steering group have any opinions on the version control hosting question ? i have sent the following requirements document to the sg so that they can reach out in their respective organizations: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1dumdbylwizzo9e6gb0iqbfqnowenwyle4plb57exb-o/edit> . this is basically what we want as a start - if you have comments on this , it is still not too late . i still don\\'t know how much this will cost and who will be able to provide it . once we know how much it costs , i will look for money . slow process - i wish we could start already . <@u0kv7fvnv> , did you have chance to talk to andreas (scm gitlab) to check their requirments . i need to write him an email - who exactly is maintaining it ? can you please give me his contact ? but just to clarify also to <@u23htrtjt> the plan is to start in-house (house = nordics) and later perhaps move to commercial if needed . <mailto:andreas . bach@uninett . no|andreas . bach@uninett . no> . ah ! it\\'s him - ok . thanks sabry . and when you\\'re talking about how much it costs are you talking about person costs , (virtual) hardware cost or both ? hmm ... looks like it\\'s hardware costs . about hardware/infrastructure costs - we would somehow buy or be donated the infrastructure from one of the partners and then we would run the service . i assume that we would have enough personal time to maintain it but please correct me if you feel that we would not have the manpower to maintain it . of course it depends which layer we maintain and which layers are below us maintained by somebody else . yes . my goal is that we don\\'t run bare metal and maintain entire stack . i would like to float on some kubernetes or similar layer - i will probably heavily rely on <@u23htrtjt> and <@u2b3dh142> maintaining it so your opinion here counts a lot . so the idea of trying stuff out with a pilot was thrown out of the window and we\\'re talking about long term solutions already ? no i like the idea of having a pilot , i think we should work on it and as soon as we get more significant resources , we migrate to them , we should imo not wait until we have all the resources . ok . so if you have an instance where we can run gitlab without upsetting anybody , we should start with that . i think we should start with manual user management where everybody is blocked by default and we unblock manually - later we adapt to some federated single sign-on but i don\\'t want to worry about all this now . i could create an instance right now except i\\'m heading for home already . maybe tomorrow :slightly_smiling_face: . i\\'ll start by asking if we could try on top of openshift instead so the nasty business of managing operating system level stuff doesn\\'t fall on me/us . yes ideally we don\\'t want to deal with low-level stuff , the less layers we maintain the better . if we have to maintain an os , my new favourite is <http://nixos . org> - purely functional linux os where you install declaratively and can rollback everything . finally safe upgrades . morning , if anyone could advice an image , that represents tromso (to be put on social media along with our event announcement): smth like this . <http://fjordtravel . no/destination-norway/picture-gallery-tromso/> . or if you actually have one ... btw , it could be nice to attract attention to post not only the description , but also a pic of the place/city where the event is held . don\\'t you think ? i think that\\u2019s a great idea . got photos for tromso ? i haven\\u2019t ... i was thinking , that radovan might have ... how do you change the blue colour on the <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> page to another colour ? good idea with the photos , i don\\'t have better ones than the net - the one above represents it well , but make sure we have usage rights and don\\'t break copyright law . \"usage rights and don\\'t break copyright law\" - that was actually the thing i was worried about . if you don\\'t find any cc images , then i will ask my friends/flatmates , they have tons of pictures . <@u2k0egsc8> it must be somewhere here: <https://github . com/coderefinery/coderefinery . org/blob/gh-pages/assets/css/style . css> - i know this is not super helpful - you can also open developer tools in your browser and then by clicking on different page elements it should point you to the right place in the css . i need one volunteer to join the all hands meeting 2018 planning committee - the committee will be composed of 4 persons , each project donates 1 volunteer - this is to get more transparency into the planning compared to 2017 ahm which was partially planned in a not very transparent fashion by somebody called ... cough ... r . bast . yeah that guy is everywhere . somebody should really restrain him . haha yes . ask an old friend for lunch: \"sure but i have to be back at 1pm to teach my colleagues to maintain our gitlab server\" , ???, \"mind if i tag along after lunch too ? \" . yes ! <https://www . linkedin . com/company-beta/10953141/> kinda liek this . wow what a cool project ! oh that\\'s us ! :slightly_smiling_face: thanks ! :stuck_out_tongue: . ok , meeting done . will write minutes to drive . what\\'s the executive summary conclusion ? \"did you know you can buy this as a service from github and be happy with your life ? \" . of course he\\'s just transitioning to another workplace and has maintained said installation for several years so i didn\\'t expect anything less from him . but apparently for gitlab project export to work the two instances must have the same export format version , which changes every now and then . if you want to migrate gitlab data , then the versions need to match - github is for us unfortunately out of question because at the scale we want to run , it is astronomically expensive . export format versions need to match . they fortunately don\\'t change with each version . nobody had any ideas for no-downtime upgrades . what type of installation does uit have ? source or omnibus ? i think reasonable downtime during upgrades is acceptable . uit has a super old version which i inherited , i am too scared to touch it and upgrade it now . yup , skipping versions is not supported . <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1oqu5ujahh5afvb6iggpyn8sflz9ts_s6ailczkejb8e/edit> . thanks jyry ! very useful stuff there . do you guys have some server/service that we could use without paying money to start and grow the beta version ? later as soon as we get \"proper\" resources we would migrate to those . sure , i think i can start one up with my own authority as long as it doesn\\'t eat up too much resources . also , w . r . t . the requirements document: the daily backups for 7 days on the system level pretty much dictates vmware or similar approach . snapshotting running disks is poorly supported on other platforms . as to backup: we don\\'t have to snapshot entire disk , we could manually backup only the git repos (trivial) and the database (they have good migration scripts) . so imo we are not restricted to vmware . otoh gitlab contains a rake task for backing up all the essential data . yes . mind if i edit the document to reflect that ? what resources can you get hold of without raising eyebrows ? please edit , yes . i believe enough to get a main instance , requisite disk and a couple of runners running without raising eyebrows . oh also , my friend promised to give me statistics about repository size distribution . 3500 (student) repos took up about a terabyte of disk space and the database dump was &lt; 200 mb because the db is supposed to be minimal anyway . that\\'s good info on the terabyte disk , wow - please add it to the docs . at uit we currently occupy 30 gb for 500 users and 1000 projects . apparently the repo size is pareto-distributed . or so i was able to surmise based on short experiences . yes , same here - very few people who use it as backup for stuff that does not belong to git and overwhelming majority of repos are very small . so we need small defaults and we let people scream and motivate why they need more and then we give them more . i would even limit repos to 50 mb to make clear that this is source code and not a data store . based on what i\\'ve gathered yesterday and today the big question to decide the installation mode of the gitlab service: source , monolithic docker or unofficial proper microservice-docker . all have strenghts and weaknesses . here i am outside of expertise . i hate multiple choice questions where all answers are wrong one way or another . what are the main pros and cons ? source: you get most control but upgrade is always manual labor , official docker: probably supported in the future as well but technically done wrong , unofficial docker: done \"the right way\" but future support is uncertain . but i suppose this is at least partially stuff that should be the subject of testing . probably we may need multiple docker gitlab instances , just to make sure that service is always available . why is the official docker technically wrong ? because the same container contains the database , actual app , load balancer and redis . i . e . we can\\'t have three gitlab containers that all talk to the same same database and a load balancer that sends requests to each of the application servers . i see , thanks - yes that sounds wrong . maintaining stateful docker containers is not a simple task . well , to nitpick the database must always be a stateful container , assuming the database is in a container . what was the solution serving the 3500 students ? source ? source . no containerization , virtual machine . although they have zfs on the vm host so backing up is a matter of making a snapshot of the volume . the good thing is that with a slightly longer downtime there should be no restrictions to changing the deployment method down the road . shut down service , run export , deploy new service in a new way , move data , run import and bob\\'s your uncle . yes , we will also then exercise the migration so that once we either decide to migrate or there is a major issue , we can migrate within a day or so just by executing a well tested script . imho , sharing knowledge may be bit difficult with official docker container , as everything is bundled up for us . if one want to get insight have to dig into container . virtual machine seems to be good option . cron job to make updates ? my feeling also tends towards vm . we just burned our fingers with updating centos with a cron job because redhat decided to mess around with stuff between major versions . docker specifically . the upgrades can be automatized but not unsupervised imo - the upgrade could turn sour and better a delayed upgrade than a broken instance while we are vacationing . i don\\'t think gitlab can be automated very much , but even automating os level security updates can have unintended consequences . this looks promising but it\\'s also the thing with which i\\'m a bit worried about future support <http://www . damagehead . com/docker-gitlab/> . i think upgrades will need to be manual but we will try to limit the stack that we maintain . there are lots of \"install gitlab in 5 minutes\" guides on the web but they don\\'t say much about upgrading . yup . looks about reasonable <https://github . com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab#upgrading> . indeed ! but i\\'ll get cracking on some semi-reasonable way to install and maintain a gitlab installation on pouta (csc:s openstack) without any sso integration . it\\'s not the only thing i\\'m working on but i\\'d like to have something running by the end of next week , assuming no major issues . excellent - thank you - we need to brainstorm a good (sub)domain name . and i agree to not worry about sso now - we anyway cannot offer that scale yet . speaking of the domain name system , are you still living at benninger weg 6 in murr <@u0kv7fvnv> ? if not it might be a good idea to update the whois information for <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> . thanks yes i need to update the myriad of domain names , the address is not completely wrong since it will still reach me . <@u0kv7fvnv> any updates from steering group about who can provide us the resources we requested . no updates yet , i am also impatiently waiting . i\\'d really love to have a containerized microservices architecture because then we wouldn\\'t really need that much resources . or rather the resource need would scale directly with demand . ahh , tabula rasa problem . a name for the repository for ansible playbooks for gitlab installation ? ideas ? gitlab-playbooks ? later we can rename . we already have 8 registrations for the stockholm may meeting ! excellent ! we meet on monday - please pre-fill the agenda notes - have a good weekend ! also tromso workshop registration progressing nicely . i also got specs from a gitlab run for internal sigma2 stuff - will add it to the docs . run ? runner ? i don\\'t understand why i wrote \"run\" - probably wanted to write \"server\" :slightly_smiling_face: . good morning everyone . had a lovely weekend of spring weather over here :slightly_smiling_face: . good morning , at a . bioinformatics course usit supports , 35 students going to run parallel processing on our cluster , many things can go wrong . after a weekend of melting snow-soup we are back to where we belong (sub zero) and it is snowing as we speak . <@u2k0egsc8> i looked more into pybind11 and i think we definitely want to do that for the workshop , i have thought also more about the workshop and have more clearly in my head now what i want to do , will try to put it to paper soon . hey . <@u2k0z6mdg> will you miss today\\'s meeting ? <@u0kv7fvnv> , i will be there the meeting . good morning . grey spring here . a lot rain and warm weather this weekend , 11c at most . did cross country skiing on saturday in very wet waterish tracks . <@u0kv7fvnv> i tried out pybind11 last week - agree with you that we should include it instead of boost/numpy bindings . maybe we could implement a pseudo number generator in c++ and use it from python ? i saw some cross-country skiers too while walking in my new hiking boots on the adjacent completely dry path . one use case of pybind11 is to unit test a c++ code with python , i think it would be good to show something that is a lot faster in c++ than in python - for \"my\" part i am thinking about showing monte carlo integration outsourced from python to c/c++/fortran . <@u23htrtjt> in a while skiing will be gone the same way as the mammoth - something you only will se drawings of , perhaps the skis regarded as part of the skeleton . surely the anatomical difference between neanderthal men and homo sapiens . haha :slightly_smiling_face: . harsha called in sick so i suspect he won\\'t be at the meeting . right - he notified me . good morning team . spring has definitely arrived in stockholm , today we have sunshine and 16 degrees ! and i\\u2019ve finally started biking to work . these days i\\u2019m not sure though if the health benefits outweigh the dust and pollution i\\u2019m inhaling along the way ... <@u2234ay5a> i have moved ide session to day 3 so that i don\\'t have to talk the entire day: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-05-09-copenhagen/> - do you agree to that or do you see problems ? it\\'s fine , no worries . one thing i would like us to create one day is a map where we visualize workshops/events held and also visualized where people traveled from to attend the workshops . ... because i see that quite a number of people are traveling to our events . there is a \"logo\" folder in the drive , please check it out we now have received some drafts , please vote for your favourite and submit feedback and suggestions (there is a document for that) . wow , difficult choice ! i like most of it . yes , it\\'s awesome work . as to copenhagen , i got recommendation from our dk steering group member gerd and booked stay here: <http://www . fortunen . dk> - i will arrive may 8 and depart may 12 . and i still welcome a volunteer to join the ahm 18 planning team . if you have preferences for the logo , please voice them before the end of the week . i\\u2019ll give my feedback tomorrow . <@u0kv7fvnv> , quick informal survey tels me that there is an interest for a central repohosting . it seems people are reluctant to have their own or use the public one . something in-between needed . imnvho (in my not very humble opinion) this could be a very visible and highly used service . i will try to get more stakeholders on april 6 . i am in contact with deic who offers the possibility to host the service - we need to figure out financial and technical and support details - as soon as i know more i will communicate this to you . it could actually become one of \"the\" neic core services imo - it would be really good for neic . i agree . logo voting made easy with a table . thanks ! indeed much better . what kind of infra/platform does deic offer ? at this moment i don\\'t know more details - will communicate as soon as i know more . ok . <@u2k0egsc8> please review this: <http://neic2017 . nordforsk . org/workshops/coderefinery/> . of course everybody else welcome to give comments/suggestions . so , if i understand correctly <@u2b3dh142> and <@u2234ay5a> are coming to copenhagen . i\\'ll try to book tickets and the abovementioned hotel via the email api of our travel agent . o , my ... <@u0kv7fvnv> did you have plans for a debrief-session on the evening of the 11th that would make it impractical to travel back on the 11th ? ( i won\\'t mind at all if the answer is yes ) . i have chosen to travel on 12th because it would have been very tight for me to catch the plane - if you guys stick around , then we can have dinner together and talk about the workshop . ... catch the last plane ... hmm ... i\\'ll have to matrix a bit more . we are getting an insane amount of snow . i was just thinking if i should switch to summer tires , first in the bike and then in the car . there appear to be direct flights at 8:20 , 8:40 and 10:10 pm so justifying an extra night might not be entirely justifiably . i\\'d go on 8th . btw , did u decide on any hotel already ? it was linked above . <http://www . fortunen . dk/> . i\\'m in the process of writing an email to ask the smt services to book me a room there . and sure , i\\'ll fly in on the 8th because the morning flights are risky but flying out on the 11th is probably the only defensible thing to do . i\\'ll probably extend until the 12th and stay the extra night on my own expense though :slightly_smiling_face: . seems like fortunen is not available from smt ? fortunen is not available via the http api . fortunately there is a person behind the email api so i\\'m trying that . i\\'ll let you know how it goes . oke . did u find this hotel via api first ? i wonder how flexible smt are . on such matters . no , but we are paying them for the hotel and flight booking service so it\\'s not terribly far-fetched to imagine they might actually serve . of course this being a nordic/soviet bureaucracy your guess is as good as mine . please keep me updated on this ... :slightly_smiling_face: . i expect at least a day for them to respond . for me if i go through the official hotel booking , there is no hotel within 5 km range , so i just booked it myself directly . <@u2b3dh142> <@u2234ay5a> we got special permission from hr to \"just book the hotel yourselves\" \\\\o/ . :smile: . fortunen\\'s website is stating , that one can have a room without a shower/toilet ... i begin to become sceptical about the place . it\\'s something above a hostel or vandrarhem but below a hotel . (i went ahead and spent neic money on my own bathroom) . btw , when are you arriving/leaving so we can take same flights if possible . how did u book ? email . ou ... that\\'s extreme ... yes , email is the way to go - i called them on the phone and they recommended me to use email instead , it\\'s probably not a fancy place . got it . thnx . hey . could someone please check , if the \"keep slack opened\" event in google calendar for next monday (3 . 04) is still there 4u ? i don\\u2019t see the \\u201ckeep slack opened\\u201d for next monday , but i see it for the monday after (10/3) . thnx , and what about now ? now i see it on mon 3/4 . good , thank you again . <@u0kv7fvnv> , you talked about interfacing matlab , have you deliberately left it out in the mma or do you still plan to include it ? i think we should include it but i did not want to promise it until i know how it works , i have never tried it . right , i have nothing else to add to the schedule . looks like a interesting workshop/tutorial:slightly_smiling_face: . yeah we should go ! :slightly_smiling_face: . it is on my daughters birthday , so it better be successful . she was a little bit surprised that i would not be present . oh ! <@u0kv7fvnv> is it useful to give a talk on coderefinery @ nordugeid conference introms\\xf8 in june . i can a arrange a tentative slot if you like . typo: nordugrid . during the conference part of nordugrid i am attending another meeting which is running in parallel . <@u0kv7fvnv> , could a nother ream member speak ? from my perspective: absolutely ! i might be able to sneak away from the other meeting but i welcome also if not everything goes through me - i would like to build a culture where we take tasks and i give possible advice and direction instead of me distributing tasks - at the moment i don\\'t know how to achieve this :slightly_smiling_face: . only four people have submitted feedback on the logo - this makes proposal 1 the one to select and refine - you have until monday evening to protest . good morning colleagues , hope you had a good weekend . mine was good , spring seems to be back after a brief pause last week . good morning colleagues , days are getting warmer , but mornings are still cold in finland . hi . good morning , grey &amp;&amp; showers in trondheim in the weekend - not very remarkable in any way . hm , seems it already has slipped what i did \\u2026 . it seems we almost have a winner logo already ! i was over the weekend dusting off a code i wrote four years ago and was shocked what a horrible code i wrote back then - things that never happen: looking at old code you wrote and thinking: \"hm ! that\\'s a well written code ! \" . <@u0kv7fvnv> when that happens you know your skills are declining so be happy you\\'re still on an upward curve . we had all 4 seasons in southern finland this weekend , albeit a cold summer for that . i was out hiking and am now sore all over and pleased to be indoors again :slightly_smiling_face: . here it\\'s snowing but forecast says temperature will go up tomorrow to 6 degs and we expect rain , lots of rain on top of lots of snow: no fun . when i was sick , i really wrote some ugly hack , but the result was that it works , so chances are unfortunately very slim i\\'ll rewrite the code right now . so next time when i will want to change something , i\\'ll likely look at it again and think: oh my god , why did i do it like this ? \"good enough\" and \"perfect\" don\\'t know much of each other .... i agree - this weekend i rewrote something from \"horrible\" to \"ok enough\" :slightly_smiling_face: . tommorow we start teaching hpc: <https://www . uio . no/english/services/it/research/events/hpc_for_research_april_2017 . html> , this week will be very bussy , sorry for any possible dealys in replying . good luck ! i\\'ll see you soon there ! <https://twitter . com/codewisdom/status/848845707708706816> . <@u0kv7fvnv> any news on the gitlab hardware ? if there\\'s no progress i\\'ll just whip up an installation without so much effort into orchestrating backups if it\\'s unlikely that the final system will be on top of openstack . sorry , no - i will meet michaela this morning and we see how we move things forward - i will discuss with you this afternoon on how we proceed with this . so ... wait until afternoon ? yes , please wait until this afternoon - i will inform you then about the status of things . k . jyry: so there are several routes for the hosting but it might take weeks if not months until they materialize (it requires negotiations , drafting service level agreements , etc . ) - i recommend that we start our own server , grow it , later migrate it to whatever platform crystallizes - does that sound reasonable ? the data migration *should* be simple enough . and yes , sounds reasonable but i won\\'t put excessive effort into backups etc . in this temporary arrangement then . well , i think backups are important since the backend is temporary but not the data . in other words i would like to get users on the system asap and later migrate transparently (with some downtime) . making backups is not impossible , it\\'s just that if i make backups from a pouta instance to another pouta instance it only protects against administrator errors . vs . also protecting against system failure . because of the way pouta is set up any disaster that destroys a volume pretty much destroys them all . i\\'ll admit that admin errors are much more likely though , as the disks are triple verified . can we backup to a volume that is the same system ? outside the same system . not sure what i write is clear :slightly_smiling_face: can we \"scp\" backups from time to time to a server that is somehow \"outside\" ? we could , but for any real amount of data that\\'s a whammy . a snapshotting filesystem like zfs would be really good for stuff like this but setting one up for the purposes of this is a bit overkill as i lack that experience . rsyncing (in that case) the local backups to a vmware instance in a different site is how i\\'m currently setting up the back-ups of another system . but the vmware instances cross internal administrative lines and are billable internally . and sure , backing up to another pouta volume on another system is possible , it\\'s an ugly hack imo but it should protect against admin error . we will need to back up somehow - if space is an issue , i can try to get some backup space here . we only need to back up in case we intend to launch the first installation . my plan is that we actually launch asap but don\\'t advertise too broadly - i really want to get a production service up before summer and i am increasingly worried that i won\\'t get the big resources before summer but i think we can start small and grow and migrate - so for me backup is an important ingredient . for me the plan would be: 1) test server is up , we test it ourselves but accept that all data can get lost at any moment , 2) we practice upgrades . 3) we practice a full recovery from backup , 4) we open it to a limited public , 5) we grow , 6) eventually we migrate with a day or so downtime to a bigger rig . ok , i\\'m glad to hear you hadn\\'t planned on skipping the test step because i was a bit worried about that . but yeah , my plan was to set up a test server and let you guys test it and also other csc employees test it to see if it looks good with 0 guarantees for data durability . yes i agree with this strategy , during test step we assume that it can go up in flames any moment . so i don\\'t need to set up any complex backups before i install the system proper . right , we can do that as step 2 or 3 . when backing up , do you need any gitlab things backed up , or the backup is for the repos . both . gitlab comes with a built-in script that backs up almost everything in a huge tarball , including database dump and all the repositories . so when we start , if we do not have backup solution . is it possible to use gits federation to have a mirror of all repos . no . but it\\'s not about whether or not we have a backup solution , it\\'s about whether or not we have a good and durable backup solution . ok . i can trivially just copy abovementioned tarballs to another openstack volume on another host in the same project . that is not durable against data center fires etc because all the data is in the same container up in kajaani . but especially if this will not be a final solution and we will ramp up use slowly i find that acceptable . we need to gradually grow into this . same datacenter backup is ok for the start , later we will rsync or similar to a remote place . bast: when do you land ?, which hotel are staying in . we will create business card designs - you will of course be free to neither print or use them - if you have a title and want to have a title next to your name on the business card , please inform me . update on yesterday\\'s meetup in oslo: sabry did a great job at moderating the discussion , we had a very good discussion and sabry managed to involve everybody in the room - he prepared by learning the background of everybody in the room , impressive . downside: many people did not show up - that\\'s a challenge that we need to think about for stockholm . i think that the people who did show up , enjoyed it . good to hear , good work ! did people participate in the discussions ? how much steering was required ? yes , i wrote down notes - will share them asap . the discussion was very lively , but what was good was to ask specific questions to specific people and then let the room talk about it . this worked very well . there was never silence . excellent . i presented coderefinery during the application expert meeting last wednesday . most people had heard of it from previous snic meetings but it was good to provide more background and updates . at least on ae from link\\xf6ping and one from uppsala will come to stockholm in may . <https://twitter . com/coderefine/status/849381760106418177> . *one ae . super ! <@u0kv7fvnv> thank you for the kind words , may be if i had mentioned that parcipants do jot need a prior knowledge that may have helped . still i gave two chances for people to inform me if not coming . . what we should do for events is to attach google cal and microsoft outlook cal invites so that it shows up in their calendars and people don\\'t forget - what i think sometimes happens is: 1) there is an email about an event which sounds interesting , 2) person registers , 3) person forgets about it and weeks later double books , 4) person feels embarrassed or is just lazy to cancel and just silently drops the other event - if it is in their calendar the chance is smaller that people double book . for internal people i used the outlook invite feature . for internal people i used the outlook invite feature . it\\'s a difficult problem with no-shows , one way to avoid it is to let them pay a nominal fee , this works but lowers the number of initial registrations and also increases bureaucracy . <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u2l0js68k> <@u23htrtjt> <@u2b3dh142> <@u2234ay5a> will you come to neic 2017 conference ? right , i haven\\'t heard back from aleksi about if he needs help . i\\'ll get back to you on monday . also it at least now seems like i\\'m pretty far along in orchestrating the gitlab installation so you could have that to play sometime on monday . nope . very good ! (gitlab) . nikolai: it\\'s not interesting or relevant ? neic would pay for it . or bad time ? timing is fine , but the topics are yes , not that much relevant . however quite interesting) . next week i will say hello to the polar bears on svalbard - i might not be so much online then - hope you guys get some time off , too - have a nice easter and take the time to celebrate the good work and recharge for the challenges ahead ! <@u0kv7fvnv> , i am not attending neic 2017\\' . hehey , was utilizing my civil rights this weekend . cultural weekend here: attended a concert and watched 3 movies . <@u0kv7fvnv> yes i\\'ll be able to attend neic 2017 . where do i sign up ? i installed summer tires to my bike and now life is smiling again :slightly_smiling_face: . neic 2017 - use this link: <https://www . axacoair . se/go ? pshq2mtv> . <@u2234ay5a>: me too . my candidate was not elected , with a margin of only one vote . annoying . <@u060ffc15> in espoo or in helsinki ? was this some regional election ? espoo . yes , local community councils . we might have had the same candidate in that case :slightly_smiling_face: . :-) . where do i get that info (on candidate - would be curious to know if it passed) ? <https://vaalit . yle . fi/tulospalvelu/kv2017> . select your municipality , and there should be a list of the candidates - passed as wel as non-passed ones . thnx . cool stuff ... data is there , fast , open and transparent . if only i could vote from home ... :stuck_out_tongue: . hi all . i spent all saturday on breaking my back , helping a friend prepare his plot of land in the archipelago for house building . had pains all over yesterday . i have a new speaker for the stockholm may event . i haven\\u2019t heard more from spotify and i started worrying that they might not make it , so i asked someone i know working at subset ab (<https://www . subset . se/>) to present an industrial perspective on collaborative development and testing . is it expensive to get unbuilt plots in the archipelago ? they paid around 700 , 000 sek for on the order of 1000 m2 . this is in m\\xf6ja , so in the outer archipelago . is there a ferry there or is it by boat only ? i\\'m really envious of the stockholm archipelago . my grandparents have a lakeside summer cabin in the saimaa region but it\\'s like a 4 hour drive so not really practical from helsinki . boat\\u2019s go there on a regular schedule , takes around 3h from central stockholm but only 1 . 5h if you go by car as far as you can . yeah it\\u2019s really beautiful out there . thanks for arranging the speaker ! set \"86 . 50 . 168 . 91 <http://gitlab-test . coderefinery . org|gitlab-test . coderefinery . org>\" in your /etc/hosts and you should be able to access the test instance . i *hope* i\\'ve gotten all the permission issues under control . but anyway , give me a shout and i\\'ll give you admin access or permission to create repos . hotel fortunen said they have booked a room for me , but didn\\u2019t mention how to pay the booking fee . have you paid any booking fee ? did they mention a booking fee ? no ! they just said they booked the room . then i would guess that there is no booking fee . we have 20 registrations now for the stockholm may event . there are two more snic application experts who want to attend but haven\\u2019t yet registered . probably time to close the registration now . one lesson learned: the registration-time question \\u201cdo you have any material that you would like to share with other attendants ? \\u201d doesn\\u2019t work , people don\\u2019t answer it . it\\'s kind of open ended . even though it\\'s technically a yes-no question . is the gitlab test online at the moment . you can\\'t access it ? there\\'s o cname for it in the dns . surprising , a bit ... : <https://www . linkedin . com/learning/learning-notepad-plus-plus-for-developers/welcome> . yeah , unfortunately it isn\\u2019t possible with a free typeform account to have logical branches (as in having different next questions depending on if \\u201cyes\" or \\u201cno\") . i also did not pay anything yet for fortunen . and i cannot reach <http://gitlab-test . coderefinery . org> . <@u21ph491q> i expect that few people will not show up so let\\'s oversubscribe a bit . i agree <@u0kv7fvnv> , let\\u2019s oversubscribe a bit . in case we have too many people , we will not drag them out like on the united flight :slightly_smiling_face: rather we will have a really luxury problem . yeah we don\\u2019t want a public relations disaster\\u2026 :wink: . thor , would you mind transferring the registrations from <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1bf_-tpkgsjtv6c_xib1qmisdsvofmrwn8qejeghc5r4/edit> to <https://docs . google . com/spreadsheets/d/1hrwhgwdapapxqvo1fgd1_h5ij7cachcroqj3ek3s69i/edit> ? compulsory reading: <http://journals . plos . org/ploscompbiol/article ? id=10 . 1371%2fjournal . pcbi . 1005412> . <@u0kv7fvnv> , will do . reminder that we meet tomorrow - i have yet to create an agenda but i want to talk about git repo hosting and prepare us for the copenhagen workshop . tomorrow ? ouch . i\\'m out giving training all day but i\\'m playing second fiddle so i\\'ll try to find a quiet corner . if you cannot make it , please have a look at agenda and add your info , then we at least talk asynchronously :slightly_smiling_face: . sure . this is cool: <https://openbadges . org> . how about we issue badges for people who attended ? they can display them if they want to and this way attract new people for workshops . i like this idea and think we should try it . <@u0kv7fvnv> updated the agenda a bit about gitlab . nothing particular to say about copenhagen yet . <@u21ph491q> ever run across a spoiler-reveal type of system for notebooks ? hmm , no not that i remember . what is it ? i haven\\'t either . i\\'d like to make a notebook that has the core story and then more stuff that is hidden for more advanced students . but a quick google didn\\'t tell me an easy way to do it . you mean hiding some cells ? yeah , and displaying a \"show me\" button . ok . there\\u2019s this tab view feature where you can toggle between input and output cells , see here <https://www . youtube . com/watch ? t=19&amp;v=wwotzvokejq> . and the other workaround is of course to include advanced topics in separate files and have a commented out \\u201c%load filename\\u201d cell in the notebook . neither accomplish exactly what you want of course . oh but look at this ! <https://github . com/kirbs-/hide_code> . that\\'s almost what i need , thanks . where do i find the sources for logo image/gif ? i have put my cropped gif into the logo folder - it is not really hires though , i cropped it out of the pdf . <https://buffer . com/> . wait a bit with the logo gif , we will soon get official sources which will probably be better quality than what i did . linkedin is an ass . should we have some small package about copyright and licensing of stuff and code in particular ? yes i think we really need that . 3 hours about that is quite hard , but a simple 1 hour introduction with gross oversimplification might be doable . yes 45 mins short and sweet . check out chapter 9 in producing open source software , <http://producingoss . com> . version 2 is out now . interesting ! thanks ! looks like good material and i am interested in good material on this . <@u23htrtjt> <@u2b3dh142> is <http://86 . 50 . 168 . 91> behind a firewall ? jyry seem to have open the ports to the outside world . probably , some iptables rules . shouldn\\'t be . but the frontend should only respond to requests with host as <http://gitlab-test . coderefinery . org|gitlab-test . coderefinery . org> so accessing via ip only might not be possible . i cannot connect to it and i think i have the right /etc/hosts entry . same with me the host is not reachable . i am suspecting that some package may have enabled iptables . check the iptables rules . i\\'ll check the firewall rules . <@u2b3dh142> are you inside the csc vpn ? yes . odd , because i can access it without issue . did you connect to https ? i\\'m not sure if the redirect from http is there by default . https works , did not know or forgot , http redirect does not work but is not important now . i am registered , can you allow me to create projects ? yeah , not having the redirect is a bit odd , probably a configurable feature . sure . you should have admin priviledges and a 20 project limit for starters . let me know when you\\'re done for the day . i thought i\\'d create a backup tar , destroy the servers and re-create them and restore from backup . ok i just tested few things and it runs smooth as vodka . i am now done with testing for today . great . next steps to test (not today) is to try to upload a gigantic repo (the server should bounce that) . in other words we need to test the data limits per repo . i ran into an interesting permissions problem before i had the chance to back you up . so whatever small changes you did you\\'ll have to do again tomorrow , including creating the user . no problem at all . https works . my bad didn\\u2019t try https . looking at openstack security rules i thought http will work . i don\\'t remember if i opened 80 but if you looked then sure , it might . totally different issue: someone from saab registered for the stockholm may event . there\\u2019s no problem accepting someone from a private company , right ? will be interesting to hear how he found out about it . i suppose they have an r&amp;d department with academics or academic minded people too . you know they\\'re from saab or are they just using a saab email address ? no i don\\u2019t know , his name is very common and it\\u2019s impossible to find out whether he has an academic affiliation as well . indeed saab does lots of research , simulating their airplanes and such . but all very industrial and secrety . *top gun theme music* ( slack has odd hilights) . haha - imo it\\'s cool and will just add to a good discussion . :stuck_out_tongue: . saturday i was snowboarding in wonderful powder , yesterday all day drinking coffee , eating cake , and coding . hi , . hi , i had a mostly quiet weekend . went downtown and saw the cherry blossoms blooming . and there was the march for science , but we missed that\\u2026 . science is at risk in sweden so people have to defend it ? :slightly_smiling_face: . exactly , science isn\\u2019t under any thread in sweden so that part is mute . but i think the whole thing was more outwards looking . is there a meeting today ? i don\\'t think so . no next meeting is may 2 . ack . i had a look again at openbadges that radovan brought up the other day . i think it\\u2019s a nice idea , shall we try it out ? i could prepare it for the troms\\xf8 workshop . <https://openbadges . org/> for those who don\\u2019t remember . yes please - i think this would be great to try out . hey , i wonder where can the results of the survey for copenhagen workshop be found ? i will share this later today . cool , thnx . i\\'m mostly interested in language and ide distributions . :wink: . challenge: we need to be able to measure the success (or failure) of our workshops - idea: we ask participants 3 months after the workshop to write 3 sentences about what changed or didn\\'t , the challenge is to make people actually reply , ideas how ? a cookie reward ! <@u2234ay5a> <https://radovan . typeform . com/report/l3nro0/pegd> . reward: yeah something like that , cookie or postcard or stickers snail mailed . it is super important that we can measure what we do , i look for ideas how we do that . when it comes to awarding open badges for completing our workshops , it may make sense to require the students to demonstrate that they\\u2019ve actually learned something . one idea would be to have a short test which is sent out to students a month after a workshop , and in relation to that ask the students to describe what has changed in their programming practices . i . e . to bundle these two . if we could bundle the attendance cert there also :smile: . problem is we cannot delay the cert 3 months . as to test: i would like to measure whether practices have changed , not so much whether people remember some commands . for future workshop we can make this the \"terms of agreement\" to supply us with 3 sentences after 3 months . sounds good to me . we could even request it from the participants from the stockholm and espoo workshops . regarding requirements for obtaining an open badge , this obviously needs more thought and discussions . yes , it is important to communicate that there is no right or wrong answer , we just want to know whether we managed to induce a change . i would like that workshop attendants \"pay\" for our workshops in terms of immediate feedback and +3 months feedback . 3 months ? i\\'d request people to identify 3 things where they could (not necessarily will) apply the knowledge gained in the week after the workshop . benefits: comes immediately , doesn\\'t assume that a 3-day workshop actually changes everything . we\\'re just sowing the seeds of change . good idea - is 3 months too short ? too long ? the problem is that imo we cannot really measure impact during the workshop but it has to somehow happen later . too long . 2 ? i feel a week is pushing it because people will forget and be inclined not to answer any questionnaire afterwards . sure , we can ask all our alumni at e . g . 6 or 12 month intervals but i\\'d expect response rates to be low . i think everything below 1 month is too short to implement a change , sometimes people have other meetings or vacation after our workshop and no time to sit down and change anything . i can compromise for 2 months . but do you actually want to measure implementing a change ? that\\'s a very challenging goal . both to measure and to achieve in 3 days . yes i want to measure it and also induce it . if we don\\'t measure , we don\\'t know whether we induced it . if we don\\'t induce it , should we continue doing it ? i have nothing against setting the bar high , but there should be intermediate goals . good point , what are they ? and we cannot induce a change in 3 days but we maybe can induce it in 2 months with the goal to get people motivated during 3 days to implement a change in the months to follow . a bit different approach is to consider workshops only as a pr activity to promote \"services\" (own hosted github/ci) . then we count the amount of users and we are fine :slightly_smiling_face: . i think using our infrastructure and adopting ok practices are two different measures , there will be some overlap but we will have many workshop attendants who won\\'t use our infra and probably also many people who use infra and never come to any of our workshops - my speculation , i have no numbers to support that . kind reminder/request that we really need now the entire team reviewing and commenting on the entire workshop stack , not only \"your\" lessons - thank you . i have re-registered to <https://gitlab-test . coderefinery . org> - can you please re-enable me ? what is the data limit per repo ? good news everybody: we will buy a paid typeform subscription , then we can share registration boards and more . <@u0kv7fvnv> :+1: . thanks <@u23htrtjt> for the account - what is the data limit per repo ? great news about typeform . this means we also get access to nicer features in the forms . like branching . yes , and auto-notifications to participants . yeah that\\'s a huge plus . regarding student feedback . shouldn\\'t we just go ahead and try it with our previous attendants ? i can start drafting questions . i think we do have some goodwill left from our happy customers , so the reply rate won\\'t necessarily be that low . or actually , we can just try radovan\\'s idea directly , asking students to write 3 sentences . yes let us try , if you can draft something that we refine on monday that would be fantastic . i am ready to send a postcard from tromso with our stickers (as soon as we have them) to everybody who answers . great . by the way , regarding the business cards . have you sent your details to nina <@u0kv7fvnv> ? does anyone else want cards ? i think i\\'ll ask for it . oh i completely forgot . will do tomorrow . . <@u0kv7fvnv> i haven\\'t changed a limit so it\\'s probably whatever is the default . and sorry i apparently have been off slack for a couple of days . as to measuring change i\\'d have three steps , 1) inform (or be informed) 2) identify 3) implement . a single researcher can identify a bunch of things that could be improved on but only effect change in a few . but if we emphasize identifying then that researcher can later try to guide summer interns etc . towards better practices at even longer intervals . and w . r . t . the postcards , sending the request via a postcard/letter could be an interesting trick . i\\'ve used that with some success in standing out from the crowd . a handwritten note \"dear xxx , we\\'re writing to you because we need your feedback to improve our offering . could you please go to\" + non-handwritten url . yes , hand written things make a huge difference and by change i mean change in own work it is indeed too much to ask for to measure change in other people\\'s work . should i try to bomb the server with some data heavy commits ? push a couple . then i\\'ll make a backup and try to restore it . if you want i can restrict repo size first . <@u0kv7fvnv> let me know when you\\'re done with the commits ? i have meetings whole day so i cannot test before this evening . please restrict size and i will do some tests tonight . it\\'s nothing that can\\'t wait until after the weekend . fun fact: the repository size checks appear to be a paid feature of gitlab . so you cannot set a repo size limit in the community edition ? if there is a switch i can\\'t find it or references to it . ok not a too big deal , then we need to monitor sizes and annoy people if repos get too large . partial success in restoring from a backup . something kept the wiki from being backed up . could be due to the fact that the version i tried this on is 6 months old . a couple of permissions issues with the backup file that need to be resolved manually but nothing major . super ! do you still want me to do some commits and stuff ? i\\'m in the process of updating to the latest version . but sure , why not . we can re-do the backup restore e . g . on tuesday and check if the wiki issue is fixed . but other than that i\\'d be ready to start getting a dns record and an actually signed certifiate . awesome ! i will do some random commits tonight . for the certificate we will go with letsencrypt . for branding/visibility purposes a * . <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> subdomain would perhaps be good . i am thinking either <http://repo . coderefinery . org|repo . coderefinery . org> or <http://hub . coderefinery . org|hub . coderefinery . org> or <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> . or we go for the more fun <http://spaghetti . coderefinery . org|spaghetti . coderefinery . org> or <http://melange . coderefinery . org|melange . coderefinery . org> as suggested in a meeting . <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> somehow flows best in my ear . i asked a colleague: 1 . hub 2 . source 3 . repo . just tested few things on gitlab-test and it looks good and responsive , very nice ! i have submitted a mixed martial arts workshop proposal for <http://rse . ac . uk/conf2017/calls/> (today was deadline) . i am about to clean up our install instructions and would like to relicense our material from cc-by to cc-by-sa , any objections ? hey) . weather was bad here over the weekend which meant: cinema , coffee , indoor coding . reminder that we have a meeting today . weather sucked on the weekend but got real nice for monday . bast: i will be travelling in the afternoon today , so i can\\'t attend the meeting . i was on a skitrip in the mountains with friends from saturday to yesterday . wonderful days , varying weather and skiing conditions , but yesterday was awesome . thanks <@u060ffc15> - safe travels . the weather forecast here was proper storm on saturday , but it didn\\u2019t turn out to be that bad . which was fortunate , because i went to this island again to help a friend build a house . even though it\\u2019s somewhat rewarding , this sort of work makes me appreciate having a quiet office job ! following up the question in our meeting , stackoverflow of course had an answer to why github and gitlab use different nomenclature: tools such as github and bitbucket choose the name pull request since the first manual action would be to pull the feature branch . tools such as gitlab and gitorious choose the name merge request since that is the final action that is requested of the assignee . thanks ! today i added one simple ubuntu ci runner to the gitlab installation . <@u0kv7fvnv> so i\\'d need a cname record for <http://hub . coderefinery . org|hub . coderefinery . org> to point to <http://vm0091 . kaj . pouta . csc . fi|vm0091 . kaj . pouta . csc . fi> and then the private and public keys for the ssl key . the private and public keys are generated by letsencrypt . will now try to set cname ... i have now set the cname but it might take time to propagate and i might have done it wrong . great . <@u23htrtjt> what is your gut feeling on <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> vs . <http://hub . coderefinery . org|hub . coderefinery . org> ? i dunno . i think there\\'s a bit of irony in calling a git*lab* instance hub . a colleague told me that hub . * associates with github or docker hub . i tend to agree . should we go for source . * ? to me the \"source . code\" part reads and memorizes nicely . at least that\\'s a good indicator that it\\'s supposed to be for source code and not other artefacts . i think so too , let\\'s be clear - i will switch the dns in a minute . i don\\u2019t have any permissions on the cmake and documentation repos in our organization , and i can see that these two repos aren\\u2019t included here: <https://github . com/orgs/coderefinery/teams/staff/repositories> . and i can\\u2019t change it myself it seems\\u2026 . (i\\u2019ve added the jupyter repo now also with write permissions to all members) . <@u21ph491q> this is now fixed . thanks ! <@u23htrtjt> i have removed archaeology and branch design from the collaborative part: <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-collaborative/> - we now have more air in this session , feel free to add stuff , last time we had no time for archaeology and branch design . reminder: everybody who is not super busy preparing material should please help out with prs and open issues (thanks thor for submitting changes) . <@u23htrtjt> will we also be able to offer <https://docs . gitlab . com/ce/user/project/pages/index . html> ? i don\\'t know . hadn\\'t realized that existed too . not top priority now but perhaps it \"just works\" and it would be a pretty cool service . hmm . what country is neic incorporated under ? what do we put into the csr ? let\\'s take no . state or province ? you can take troms , troms (there is no \"\\xf8\" at the end) . if we define troms\\xf8 as the hq :slightly_smiling_face: . organization name ? coderefinery . coderefinery ? did we have an info@coderefinery org or similar contact email address that\\'s not tied to a person ? if not i\\'ll just put your email address here . and in other places as the point where to send expiry emails . <mailto:info@coderefinery . org|info@coderefinery . org> should forward to me , you can use that one . now if this works even remotely then you can color me surprised . <@u23htrtjt> i plan to do quite many changes to git intro , do you prefer me to push directly or via prs ? prs have the obvious advantage to have some code review , disadvantage is lots of spam for you in the next days . my plan is to add more on motivation , possibly replace python by some language-independent example , extend staging and branching part . either directly or by a couple of large prs . ok i will try to do trivial stuff directly and the reviewable parts via not too fine-grained prs . now if you\\'ll cross your fingers i think <http://source . csc . fi|source . csc . fi> might be available and have a valid certificate from letsencrypt . automating letsencrypt re-certification using the gitlab docker image proved beyond me so we need to manually re-obtain the certificate before summer holidays . and then every 3 months rolling until i fix the letsencrypt automation . seems to work :slightly_smiling_face: . manual renewal is no problem , takes 5 mins , only challenge is not to forget . hi you guys ! how did you set this alias up <http://bit . ly/coderefinery-drive> ? using <https://bitly . com> - you can shorten links and set own aliases , caveat: in the free bitly you cannot change the long url behind a shortened link . exactly , so how did you do it :smile: . errr .... i mean the aliasing part . i couldn\\'t figure out how to do that :slightly_smiling_face: . i took the long google drive link , pasted it to bitly , it gave me a short ugly link which i then changed to \"coderefinery-drive\" . ah , you probably need a bitly account for that and do it once logged in . ok . yup - seems you cannot edit links anonymously . if you want to stay completely anonymous , you can use <https://tinyurl . com> . ok i now got this <http://bit . ly/tryggve> . thanks ! cool url ! it\\'s nice to be first . (tryggve was taken) . oh . then i hope the lowercase one is not a nsfw site :slightly_smiling_face: . yeah . playing around now with whatever else i can get . now tryggve-drive works . <@u23htrtjt> looks good ! <https://source . coderefinery . org> - let me know when it is fine for me to register and start using it . <@u23htrtjt> i will push my changes directly to the git-intro repo , i plan to do large structural changes and time is pressing and i also don\\'t want to distract you from your work , please trust that i thought about the structure a lot and won\\'t do anything bad :slightly_smiling_face: . lessons aren\\'t really programs so some edit protocols don\\'t make as much sense . i have switched to a guacamole example: <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-intro/02-basics/> - this will also nicely fit for branching (recipe variations) and conflicts (conflicting ingredients) . took me a while to figure out that you hadn\\'t found an esoteric programming language called guacamole . :slightly_smiling_face: . i\\'d be willing to bet there are at least 3 libraries called guacamole and none of them have anything to do with mexican food . it\\'s a good and tasty name . speaking of star wars day , as soon as the gitlab is up and running and ready for the masses , i want to announce it with a darth vader meme \"use the source ! \" :slightly_smiling_face: . oh yeah <@u0kv7fvnv> the gitlab installation is the same as before , just served at a different address . you already have an account and need to update repo urls . ah - good , i will use it then and soon draft user-facing documentation on how to get on board . not 100% sure if the ci runners are working right now , i changed some of the configuration . that\\'s no problem , the ci stuff we will soon anyway migrate to denmark . few things to check about sending registration emails etc . can you please eventually elevate my rights on the gitlab so that i can see how new user registrations look like from the admin side ? this will help me to draft the docs . right . thought i already did but that was the previous installation . elevated . perfect , cheers - if you see registrations with test names similar to mine , just ignore , i will use that to draft a registration procedure . mr . radagast bast . <@u23htrtjt> what is your preferred way to track issues connecting to the gitlab ? don\\'t worry haven\\'t found any yet . i actually don\\'t have one . and that is one of the ops-related things we need to figure out . in the dogfooding spirit we could track issues and hold internal doc on the gitlab itself but perhaps that is risky ? at least with stuff related to the gitlab it\\'s like sawing the branch you\\'re sitting on . yes that is the risk :slightly_smiling_face: so let\\'s find something better . option 1 is trello board , option 2 is that we keep internal doc and issue tracking on <http://gitlab . com|gitlab . com> - but i don\\'t want to impose tech on you , it should be something you are comfortable with , but we also cannot track issues in our heads (at least i cannot) . option 3 is google doc . it can also be something csc centric but we need to consider the bus factor . hey you guys ! i heard you have a workshop in sthlm on may 19 . good on ya ! shouldn\\'t this be in the neic training / events calendar ? you may get a saab colleague of mine joining :slightly_smiling_face: . i recently discovered we actually have jira-as-a-service that can use edugain sso . i don\\'t have visibility to what they charge for internal customers for maintaining that though . <@u050w0wap> good point but the event is anyway already full , right <@u21ph491q> ? <@u21ph491q> we have a registration for copenhagen from chalmers - if you did something , it worked :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u23htrtjt> whatever works best for you but ideally not too expensive given that there are enough good free alternatives . yes , it worked <@u21ph491q> - more registrations from sweden - thank you for that ! the swedish news channels seem to work better than in denmark , interesting . <@u0kv7fvnv> the training calendar will be used also to do statistics on nordic training (availability etc) . both are good for general exposure for good efforts . the training calendar is used to generate weekly announcement emails on nordic training . the events calendar is displayed on the frontpages of the neic external wiki and official website . i understand and agree but it is currently beyond my resources to do all these manual steps . but i will think about how we can automatize this better . what i can promise to deliver is that we will deliver a detailed report on coderefinery training which then can be incorporated into other reports . what \"all manual steps\" ? i can do it for you . takes 3min tops . if so which calendar(s ? ) would you want to be in ? ok so i need to make clear that the neic calendar is a super thing and it is set up in a very lightweight fashion , it is just an extra step and i am notoriously overworked - we have all our events here: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/> - most of them make it to the neic calendar magically (some nice person does it and the nice person is not me) . note that i\\'m volunteering to be nice here :stuck_out_tongue: . yes i appreciate it very much also knowing how much you have on your plate . don\\'t worry about that , simple stuff like this i do just for the mental stretching :slightly_smiling_face: . so which do you want ? what are the options (sorry for stupid questions , i should know this and it is most likely well documented) . neic-training is for training events of interest to neic stakeholders . neic-events is for other things of interest to neic stakeholders (meetigs , important publications , conferences , kickoffs ... ) . <@u050w0wap> we do indeed have someone from saab signed up ! cool ! yes , the event is fully booked already , so we don\\u2019t need to put it on calendars for exposure . but if it should be there i can add it , if i have permissions . yeah , the exposure bit would be for building the coderefinery brand . ah yes , good point . (and to contribute to statistics down the line , in case of neic-training) . <@u21ph491q> what\\'s your google id ? ktwikfeldt . i agree with joel that it is good if we are visible , even if it is already full . all upcoming events are here: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/> - everything is training except the stockholm , may 19 , 2017 . <@u21ph491q> i just gave you edit rights to both calendars . thanks for adding me . so i\\u2019ll add the sthlm event then . procedure is you copy an existing event and change the text , then tell me so i can see if it\\'s fscked up :slightly_smiling_face: . thanks to both of you ! the good stuff works because of nice persons like you . neic=nice\\u2026 ? check these pages to see if you did it right: <https://neic . nordforsk . org/events/> <https://neic . nordforsk . org/training/upcoming/> . ok . check this if you feel the need to read docs: <https://wiki . neic . no/wiki/event_calendar#make_your_events_look_nice> . added , doesn\\u2019t look fscked up to me but please check . <@u0kv7fvnv> great that people from sweden registered . i added a last-minute announcement to the snic training mailinglist , which people actually seem to read . how many new ones from sweden ? confirmed , looks very nice ! . 2 persons from sweden registered today . quite striking to me to be ready to travel on such short notice . now that we have a logo and whatnot , shall we create a flyer that can be distributed in certain events ? i\\u2019m thinking of the pdc pub on may 24 , which is an outreach event where we have posters and flyers on pdc-related stuff , prace , eudat , bioexcel , serc etc . i don\\u2019t remember if we\\u2019ve spoken about this before . i think that\\'s a great idea , i am waiting for high-res logos from nina and then i also want to order some stickers . i gave git-intro a face lift: <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-intro/> - please comment (i haven\\'t touched yet the remote part and also need to trim it a bit and clean things up) . anybody here has experience with cygwin and git bash on the same system ? don\\u2019t have any such experience , unfortunately . i\\u2019ll have a look at the lessons today . basically a course participant has installed git bash next to cygwin and it broke his cygwin , even after uninstalling git bash and reinstalling cygwin . to those who will be in cph: anybody has name tags we could borrow ? i completely forgot about that . otherwise there will be no access control , coffee breaks are set , apparently lunch is even paid for instructors ( ? ) , we should get a second projector . please bring at least one name tag for you . you mean like name tags written manually or name tag holders ? holders - we can write the names manually on site . or if you can generate the actual tags i\\'m relatively confident i can print them . manually written is fine - more fun , less preparation . also less spelling errors if you let people do it themselves . yes :slightly_smiling_face: . do you have these holders ? i\\'ll go downstairs to check the office supplies . i\\'m sure we have them somewhere . oh yeah i was supposed to go downstairs . stupid email . got a box of 50 with what looks like pre-cut papers to go with them . will take it with me . wonderful ! thanks ! <@u0kv7fvnv> i thought i\\'d spend ~15 minutes on git aliases as a helpful tool . just checking to see that you\\'re not planning on talking about those in the introduction . i think it\\'s unlikely that you would given the time constraints but one never knows . confirming that i will not mention aliases . a favourite from a friend is \"git fuckit\" --&gt; \"git reset --hard head\" . haha . i will be brief on remotes so take time to explain them well . that\\'s what the first session is mostly about . i was thinking that we could maybe create some interesting merge mess for people to work on but that might be too much . if i would add something then it would be another collaborative exercise to get the whole thing into muscle memory . but i think we will be happy if we manage to do everything we already have - although there should be now a bit more air in the git-collaborative . when adding exercises it is super important imo that this is something people can relate to - many people work still isolated , for many branching will be a new thing and they may perhaps not relate to a situation where one has to swing the machete in a horrible merge mess . btw , when you\\'re\\u200b reaching copenhagen airport . i\\'ll be there at 18:00 . . 21 something . i added an issue on the git-intro repo about permissions (it hasn\\u2019t been added to the organization) , but all i wanted to add was one sentence to episode 7 under the heading github: \\u201cnote also that many universities offer git repository hosting services for students and staff; these are often based on the github or gitlab platforms . \\u201d . since the workshop starts tomorrow i don\\u2019t want to steal any time from you in changing settings on github\\u2026 . btw the lesson looks really really good . thanks <@u21ph491q> for looking over it - i will check it asap and if possible , integrate it . <@u2b3dh142> i am landing 17:20 ish , do you want me to wait for you ? i can do work at the airport to kill time . i\\'ll arrive at 17:55 . if you can wait that would be great . my first time in copenhagen , so navigating would be easy . ok i will be in the starbucks which is to the right just after you leave baggage/customs . thanks; will meet there . i cannot guarantee i will be great nav help but at least we can talk about stuff . at the hotel . the hotel is pretty much in the middle of nowhere btw so if you are going to eat today i suggest you do so underway . there\\'s a restaurant here too but i don\\'t know their opening times . oops harsha and i just had dinner downstairs - did not see your message until now . well that just proves they were open in the evenings as well . i am upstairs in the place outside the rooms . good luck you all , have a great workshop ! <@u21ph491q> i made a branch called copenhagen2017 in the jupyter repo , we can discuss about merging the changes with better time . we\\'ll have a better idea about timing and how well my changes work after today . yes i saw it last night . i skimmed through it and found your changes very good . i only later realized that the mother of all examples would be computing statistics about the age at which people receive the nobel prize . iirc it wasn\\'t there explicitly but could be computed from the other variables plus makes for excellent box plots . yes ! hmm , i actually did exactly that and i was under the impression that it was in the notebook . i must have removed it for timing reasons . was it ? i must check i recall it was mostly about the per-country statistics . idea for a fun example dataset: highest peaks in each of the nordic countries . would that be unfair towards the danes ? yeah there is already a section \\u201cage statistics\\u201d , where a histogram is generated but not a box plot . this is an interesting part and could be extended . highest peaks sounds fun , and unfair to danes ! i looked around a bit for interesting datasets to demonstrate , there are so many possibilities . actually for future reference we could make a messy dataset about the peaks and use that also as an example of tidying datasets . good idea , including something on tidying data is definitely worthwhile . how is it going in cph ? did everyone show up ? i think there\\'s 19 people in the room which would imply a couple of no-shows . created \"lessons-learned\" document in the workshop cph folder where we can collect our findings . made a simple \"lesson table\" , where marked the lessons being able to give: <https://docs . google . com/spreadsheets/d/1-pvx73ci77heoct4raf2e4cs7secgige2o3jozlop20/edit#gid=0> . < ! channel> please fill , when you have time . <https://nikolaidenissov . github . io/ides/> . i\\'d appreciate if anybody would have a moment to scroll the reworked materials through . looks great ! great work ! thnx . siri mentioned that she had been on day 1 too . ok . hmm ... most people don\\'t seem to find the installation burden too much or at least i haven\\'t heard any complaints . however i\\'m still thinking if we shouldn\\'t invest the time to make automation so we can build a virtualbox image that the participants can alternatively use . back in helsinki ! hope afternoon talk went great . you\\u200b also have a safe trip back home . it did , it did . in particular i think the feeling of structure in the content of nikolai\\'s ide presentation has improved since the first workshop in helsinki . cool , i believe there is a plenty of room for improvement still . now on my way back: great job everyone ! i will very soon type up the feedback . i agree that virtualbox image would be good , especially for windows users who don\\'t mind using a linux image during the workshop . at school . cph feedback: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1veswpnziymnzxk7imolgzekqtacuzvqpcyooyizikwy/> - please read and extract the essence of the feedback (i have put some comments in bold which i think are extra important) . good morning . beer tasting was great . if copenhagen wasn\\'t so expensive i\\'d do that every year . hm on saturday went well despite the beer tasting: i finished 4 minutes faster than i had set out for . very good :slightly_smiling_face: . i got a very encouraging email: . nice . the aalto university physically located inside one of the csc machine rooms . and i think we\\'re a little bit too close to them tbh . so if you book an extra coderefinery and we just send csc employees to implement it then that should be ok , right ? :wink: . we can all say we work for neic and just coincidentally are physically located at csc premises . the cool thing is that he has good material on things we anyway wanted to do so perhaps we can team up . <http://nbdime . readthedocs . io> . check out the nbdime for diffing jupyter notebooks . good morning guys ! glad to see that the workshop went well . thanks for the link to nbdime radovan , looks very relevant and should be included in the jupyter material . to summarize my weekend , it was dominated by a sense of satisfaction and relief that my wife\\'s dissertation went well ! excellent ! great it went well ! congratulations with your wife\\u2019s dissertation , <@u21ph491q> . <https://docs . google . com/spreadsheets/d/1-pvx73ci77heoct4raf2e4cs7secgige2o3jozlop20/edit#gid=0> . i have created <https://source . coderefinery . org/coderefinery> where we can track configuration stuff and issues , you should be able to request access to it . it is good if you start using the server also for your own stuff - don\\'t trust a chef who does not eat his own food . <@u23htrtjt> <@u21ph491q> <@u2k0egsc8> please check your names here: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-06-19-tromso/> - let me know if we need to move things around; i might remove the complexity session if we don\\'t manage to rework it and we might some more git stuff . looks good to me ! . fine for me . also if you feel it\\'s too much non-stop talking for one person we can move sessions to other days , let me know in this case or file prs . i drafted an email to ask participants 3 months after a workshop to give feedback on what has changed in their daily work . the document is in the workshops folder , \"3-month-feedback\" . one way to get people to answer it could be to award a prize to a randomly selected participant in each workshop . a usb stick or whatever . i was thinking about making a notebook for the complexity session as one of the examples for the ume\\xe5 workshop . <@u21ph491q> thanks ! i will have a look asap . good idea with the prize ! as to notebooks: what works well is incremental development of either a data pipeline or a visualization - i am a bit worried that jupyter may not serve well structural refactorings . but if we ignore file structure issues , then it can be a nice way to work . regarding jupyter for code refactoring , i think that\\'s actually something people use the notebook format for , since you can easily split cells , move them around , and so on . and then when you\\'re happy you export it to file . but it definitely doesn\\'t appeal to everyone . i think that if you have a jupyter notebook then it definitely makes sense to refactor it in jupyter - but i would not refactora python package in jupyter - i think it is great for prototyping and sharing but it\\'s something linear , right ? one can execute the cells in any order , so not linear in that sense . i guess my question is: if you have a code with 10 files - how do you refactor in jupyter ? yes there\\'s a limit to how large refactorings one can reasonably do in a notebook . 10 files is far above that limit probably . i was more thinking along the lines of moving code into and between functions and classes . a *few* functions and classes ... a completely different topic , software carpentry has this page for related projects: <https://software-carpentry . org/join/projects/> . we should be there ! <@u0kv7fvnv> you know someone from swc right ? yes good point we should be there - i will add us via a pr but first i need to make sure we properly mention swc and related things on our site as well . yes , quid pro quo . sorry for the jumping between topics , but regarding the 3-month survey . maybe it\\'s better to have a somewhat extended survey , on typeform , with more formal questions where the answer can range between \"completely disagree\" to \"completely agree\" , even if that may reduce the participation by an unknown amount . this will make it easier for us to understand more quantitatively what works and what doesn\\'t , and will be easier to present to neic , nordforsk ... if we\\'re offering a prize then it seems fair to ask for \"a little more\" than 3 sentences . these are good points - a survey is more comparable but gives less flexibility and is more anonymous (we don\\'t know who did not answer) , my worry is that we end up with very many questions - advantage of free style: we can use them as anonymized testimonials , advantage of survey: more quantitative - i don\\'t know what is better . it depends on what we want to use it for . freestyle will hardly be useful in comparing one workshop to the next , if we want to learn if some new approach or whatever worked well , or if we\\'re getting better with time . but it can be useful as testimonials , as you say , to present to funders . is that the point ? i think my main goal for this is not to compare workshops (for this i think the on-site feedback is very good) but to know whether this project/ the workshops as a whole whether it makes sense to do this . my question is: does it makes sense and do we have any effect on the workflow . okay , then i think that freestyle is much better . when funders ask themselves whether they should fund us , i would like to show them something - but i do like the quantifiability but am worried that we end up with a 40 question survey . because then statistics is just overkill i guess . it is nice to show graphs (currently we cannot since we don\\'t have any data that we could plot apart from attendance) . maybe it would be good to have a combination: something quick that people rate plus few freestyle questions but so that it fits on one page and does not scare busy people . swc has a post-workshop survey that\\'s 20 questions , and much more detailed then what i think we could use . see <https://software-carpentry . org/assessment/> . i think we could do it so it fits on one page . i agree , it is good to have something that we can plot - but also something hand written in addition . i\\'ve drafted a typeform survey with only 8 questions . it\\'s in the workshop folder , \"3-month-typeform-survey\" . i classify the questions into essential , desirable and possibly-unnecessary . please comment and change at will ! thanks for the changes <@u0kv7fvnv> , i agree with all of them . thanks for the work - it\\'s a very good start - let us think very carefully over the next days how we can compress it more and get very expressive questions - the less text in the email and the survey the better , i think it is worth if we put now a lot of effort into doing this very well since there is so much value in the outcome . agreed . i updated the document 3-month-typeform-survey , and the typeform itself is here: <https://kthw . typeform . com/to/aizopc> . (the email has to be modified accordingly of course) . those of you traveling to tromso: book flights early , end of june seems to be very expensive , probably because of tourists ( ? ) - i just bought a (vacation) flight for end of june and was shocked by the prices . <@u2k0egsc8> i was again swamped with backlog - will start building mma material tomorrow on plane , i expect to have a good first scaffold by sunday . i got advice from some more wizened colleagues and am currently refactoring the deployment playbook so that in the future i can have the exact same ansible playbook for <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> and <http://gitlab . csc . fi|gitlab . csc . fi> and version the per-installation configs in two separate repos . if you have the need to run your own gitlab installations , have access to an openstack cloud and are willing to go with the choices i\\'ve made this can be very easily adopted to suit others . <@u0kv7fvnv> have we locked down the thursday as a team work day in tromso ? <@u0kv7fvnv> also do you have opinions about comfort hotel xpress tromso ? it looks good but is suspiciously cheap for norway . let\\'s lock down thu for work for those who can (i can) - i don\\'t want to spoil people\\'s midsummer but if you can stay one extra day , please do and we can do some work . i have been in that hotel chain in oslo and it is indeed cheap and good , i don\\'t know how good the tromso version is but i expect no bad surprises . and it\\'s really great that the admin work of our gitlab and the csc one can be collocated , that\\'s great , it means that both will be more robust and the sum of admin work is less than doing each separately . <@u23htrtjt> at your earliest convenience please look at the gitlab issues on <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> - i will very soon draft some documentation and my goal is to perhaps announce a beta version at neic 2017 - what do you think about it ? it\\'s three things: the \"admin jay\" , a default admin account which i think can be deleted perhaps , and it would be really good for administration if new users can be blocked by default . spring in stockholm ! at first surprising , but then again it\\'s late may - funny how the arctic shifts the baseline . i have uploaded hi-res logos and artwork to logo/artwork . i\\'m re-running the playbook with the admin email and already disabled the root . the blocked-by-default i haven\\'t had time to look for but the other two are trivial . thanks ! <https://twitter . com/david_abergel/status/865576648342634497> . thanks thor ! great workshop . i think we need more of this - this is how we get people engaged and excited . yes it was a good event , and we should do more of it . two application experts have told me they\\u2019d like to have something similar organized in uppsala and ume\\xe5 . that\\'s very good feedback ! we\\'ve had our first warm enough weekend here in helsinki area , so grilling meat and taking sun outside :slightly_smiling_face: . i realized yesterday evening there are leaves on the trees . i mean they must have been there on friday and saturday but i didn\\'t notice until yesterday . good morning , everyone . the weekend was used for preparing the coming winter - chopping wood sticks . congrats with the workshop in stockholm , <@u21ph491q> &amp;&amp; <@u0kv7fvnv> . good morning ! i did the opposite of you this weekend <@u2k0egsc8> , i burnt wood sticks (and put some food on top of it) . sounds delicous . and then i watched some ice hockey last night , of course . for the uninitiated: sweden won over canada in world cup final . congrats to sweden ! we are still waiting here for leaves . don\\'t forget meeting today and don\\'t forget your homework for the meeting . wtf , i\\u2019m looking at trips to troms\\xf6 via our travel agency . the list includes some interesting choices: lufthansa stockholm-munich-oslo-troms\\xf6 for 52 thousand sek . fortunately there are somewhat cheaper sas flights . ha ! ive never even seen a flight that expensive . <@u2k0egsc8> i am behind schedule with workshop but don\\'t worry , now full force ahead working on it . <@u0kv7fvnv> , fine - am not to worried at the moment:slightly_smiling_face: . <@u0kv7fvnv> meeting today ? nikolaid: yes . <@u2234ay5a> i think i sent you an invite to the bus risk reduction meeting . 3pm in oberon in case i failed . accepted . sorry - when is this meeting ? i don\\'t see it in my calendar . 13:00 finland time . ok ! <@u0kv7fvnv> , did you inquire whether neic could pay for attending the rse ? i forgot to check - i believe this is no problem but i will check this . ok thanks . another question regarding our hosting service , how shall i describe it in the pdc newsletter article , considering that only a few groups will be invited initially ? what i mean is , it shouldn\\u2019t look as an open service for everyone , should it ? you mean the gitlab ? or the ci ? the gitlab . imo everybody connected to academia is then welcome to join it . ok , how about ci , should it be mentioned ? there we probably need groups to apply for it - we can mention it as perspective , i don\\'t know yet when it will become available . ci is already available with a tail-light warranty . <@u21ph491q> when are you sending the email ? i was just hinted one optimization that i\\'d like to make before taking in users . which effectively makes <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> available at port 22 and moves the command port for the system to 10022 and not the other way around that it was . no problem to wait a bit - as to the ci , the work will now (most probably) move to copenhagen to <@u2l0js68k> for organizational reasons and i don\\'t want to commit to a publicly available service before he his comfortable with that , but it is ok to mention it . you should have permissions to see this <https://source . coderefinery . org/test-project/test-ci-runner/pipelines/6/builds> . the newsletter will come out mid june , but i should send it in within a week or two . late tomorrow would be fine for me . < ! channel> - our next meeting is scheduled for jun 5 but it is both a public holiday in no and i will also be traveling - i should have checked my calendar - i suggest moving the meeting to wednesday jun 14 , 12:00 cest/13:00 eest - unfortunately i have no realistic possibility to meet earlier - we need to coordinate things over slack but that is what slack is for - for lesson preparation use the feedback and define core themes . ok by me . the 5th is also a holiday in dk so it suits me to move the date . the time coincide with a dellingr project meeting . could we hangout later (13:15 or 1400 ? ) . 14:00 cest/ 15:00 eest is ok for me - also ok for others ? please speak up if this is not good for you . fine with me . ok we place it on june 14 , 14:00 cest/ 15:00 eest , until further notice - looking forward to seeing you then ! <@u2234ay5a> will you put it on the gcal so i\\'ll get an alert ? <@u0kv7fvnv> i had an idea about doing a pair-of-pairs exercise in advanced git . yes , if the time is finally agreed now . so the idea was that two pairs of two people start with the same basic repository with some existing files . the time is fine for me . both groups make concurrent changes , first by making well-contained small branches from master and then submit to each other for review and merging . then after the \"clean\" way has been done they can try doing any of a number of things that will cause merge conflicts and try to resolve them . good idea ! i will note it in an issue so that i don\\'t forget . sorry to be a party killer , but june 14 does not work for me . but just keep it there and i\\u2019ll see what i can do . there are not many options at all in june . you ? who cares about you , <@u17t18w0k> :thinking_face: ? <@u0kv7fvnv> , for the 1st part of the workshop my thread goes like: . -motivation &amp;&amp; technolgies/tools . -examples with swig , boost and pybind11 (i am creating three different environments in anaconda and use same source code in each environment) . - the pybind11 example ends with cmake which i then dive into , and ends going back to the swig example and use cmake . -last part focus more on pybind11 . hans: just to avoid confusion - this is a date change for the team meeting , sg meeting remains on june 16 . bjornlin: thanks ! super - please document your software prerequisites on <https://coderefinery . github . io/mma/#prerequisites> , i will do the same and send out an email to participants tomorrow . i will browse through your material tonight and provide feedback . ok , sorry :slightly_smiling_face: . no problem - sorry for flooding entire channel but i needed to get people\\'s attention . good news: my workshop proposal to <http://rse . ac . uk/conf2017/> got accepted - this will boost our visibility . nice . great ! <@u0kv7fvnv> when would you have the time to change the <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> dns record ? does it need to be changed ? in other words what is missing or what changed ? i got a separate openstack project for it so in theory we can give admin access to other csc employees and possibly even external people . and when moving from one environment to another the ip address must change . ok no problem , i can change it anytime . please do so now , the new target is <http://vm0590 . kaj . pouta . csc . fi|vm0590 . kaj . pouta . csc . fi> . it\\'ll take a while to propagate anyway . is changed . thank you . service is inside the new tenant and should be visible when the dns change propagates . excellent ! do you think i can announce it next week at neic ? or is it premature ? did you have a chance to look at the user blocking ? no pressure with the announcement - if it is too early , it is too early , we don\\'t rush ourselves into trouble . everything i read says that it\\'s not possible to block newly created users and setting default projects to 0 is the way to do that . if we were to accept users from a single sign-on then we could block those users by default pending admin approval , which is what i think you meant . i have nothing against the announcement as such , but the high-level admin tasks are a bit unstructured atm . ok i will wait a bit with the announcement , now remembering that i also need to write the higher level docs first :slightly_smiling_face: . can we let all users pend admin approval ? or can this only be coupled to oauth users ? no . it can only be coupled to external identity providers . hm yes , now it also makes sense what i see on our server here , where new users are autoblocked but they come from google auth so that mystery is solved . and just my two cents i don\\'t think everything needs to be written down by launch but everything does need to be agreed on by the key people . a process can exist without comprehensive documentation but it can\\'t exist without the people involved agreeing on the process . i agree - it\\'s more for us at the beginning , i will hopefully write something up soon and of course involve you - but right now i am in headless chicken mode due to workshop and talk and neic 2017 planning . sure , no rush . oh , btw we could whitelist the email address domains from which people are allowed to register gitlab accounts . i think that\\'s a good idea - will be a bit painful in the beginning but over time we can screen out a lot of spam . it will be a pain if we expect to have all of them at the start . but if we have a request process then the list will build up over time . just have to respond to those requests within reasonable time so as not to become a barrier to entry . warm welcome to risto ! he is joining our team from csc - he is a guru in cloud tech , openstack , pouta , and many more , and will help us deploying the gitlab service . welcome ! <@u0kv7fvnv> thanks ! welcome ! about gitlab after signup ! in the gitlab admin setup there is a way to add custom text after \\u201cuser sign up\\u201d --&gt; is it good to ask to fill a google form asking motivation or send email to admin@\\u2026 then we can increase project limits from 0 . yes the custom text is a good idea - i would prefer an email motivation (i will set this stuff up after the neic2017 rush) . rse2017 registration is now open: <http://rse . ac . uk/conf2017/registration/> - it\\'s a really good conference which will fill up within days . hi , i am back at work after an family emergency at home in sri lanka . survived flood , landslide , dengue and h1n1 , but common flue defeated me , hope to be operational by monday . lot to catch up , sorry for being out of the radar for so long . my phone was water damaged and without stable internet for a while . hi sabry , hope everything is fine/better - glad you are back , take the time to recover , we will catch up next week . <@u0kv7fvnv> :thanx . for those who plan to go to rse2017 , make sure to also attend <http://wssspe . researchcomputing . org . uk/wssspe5-1/> (right before the conference) . those of you who attended neic 2017 , hope you arrived home well . now planning a bit the tromso workshop: . <@u21ph491q> have you though about the documentation session ? do you want to take that one ? i think i will drop the complexity session since i believe it needs to be reworked and fear we don\\'t have enough time to rework it - we can easily fill it out with git or other topics . so , have we already divvied the responsibility ? <@u0kv7fvnv> i\\'d like to try concretizing the complexity part with a jupyter notebook if you\\'re not strongly set on dropping it . <@u23htrtjt> here is the latest state: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-06-19-tromso/> - we can still edit , but if so , we should do it now . hmm ... right i promised to do ides . that i think will take enough preparation by itself . do the complexity next time then . as to complexity , i am open to experiments but i also feel we should not load up too much but improve what we have . sure , simplifying it to bring some basic concepts across is what is needed . <@u23htrtjt> sorry topic change , have you seen this: <https://docs . gitlab . com/ce/raketasks/user_management . html#maintain-tight-control-over-the-number-of-active-users-on-your-gitlab-installation> ? is the block_auto_created_users only for oauth users ? (i am now working on the docs for gitlab maintenance) . yes , but note that that says auto_created , i . e . users who come from a sso provider . and that\\'s what i was referring to in ume\\xe5 when i said that if we could have sso then we could auto-block them . ok good - just wanted to confirm this . bast: yeah i\\'ll take the documentation session . great - you have complete freedom . my recommendation: less text , more examples , illustrations , screenshots . bast: i registered for the rse , and will attend the wssspe as well . also i recommend to add a short intro into rst and md . yeah i thought about including a little intro to md and rst . and include a cheat sheet . as to jupyter , i recommend to make it more about jupyter and a little bit less about pandas (but the pandas session is fantastic so do not delete anything) but for me the session became a great pandas demo but for people who don\\'t use python or want to focus more on visualization or other aspects , it might be too pandas heavy - i would shorten that example . if possible i would try to demo different situations in which people can use jupyter so that they get hooked and find a usecase that fits their workflow . but again , this is just my view on things . the wssspe is great . good networking and is for free . <@u23htrtjt> <@u5l3ena15> <@u2b3dh142> at your earliest convenience please review and comment here: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1jv9fckrmqfb3xv2xvmfd86sm8ecxuzl1tujib7ymm8m/> . we have some lessons which have probably too much text but the text is good (documentation , testing , complexity) - i suggest that we reduce the \"dry text\" on these lessons a bit but we don\\'t throw the text away but at the same time create best practice guides which can be read and followed completely independently - we can then refer to them from the lessons - i will try to do that and if you think this is a good idea , feel free to join in . did a quick review with some edits and comments . sorry late reply . yes , good input and i agree . thanks jyry . concerning gitlab service: apart from the email alias , what do we need to implement before i can publish the docs online and invite users on board ? fyi , i\\u2019ll be on vacation all next week . i might read emails off and on but no promises ! have a nice vacation ! thanks . morning . <@u0kv7fvnv> nothing really in my opinion . <@u0kv7fvnv> one thing though: the \"send email to all users\" is a feature of the ee version as far as i know . we should mention if we intend to manually email all registered users about service breaks etc . just leaving this here for the working with remotes part of git training <http://www . moviequotedb . com/movies/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope/quote_29898 . html> . freaking awesome quote ! it will be used :slightly_smiling_face: . thanks for confirmation about the gitlab status - i will write about the service break notifications and put the doc online this week and then let some people in . note that there is also an option of setting notifications in the system . you mean on the screen when people log in right ? on the top of the screen on every page . yes , cool - yes let us use that too . i just worry that mailing everyone every time will become spammy . but check e . g . <https://source . coderefinery . org/dashboard/projects> now . we can make email notifications opt-in and default is only screen notifications . what\\'s the opt-in mechanism ? <@u0kv7fvnv> csc marketing dept wants to publish the coderefinery blog post i made two eternities ago late this week . what\\'s the last word on workshops coming up in finland ? and this is the blog post in question <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1whcjbaqmbbq5ponqyny5k4sivosgcemvbqyz3w6nu28/edit> . about the opt-in: perhaps we first start with desktop notifications and later we create a site where people can sign up with their email to receive notifications . about the workshop: i suggest we use the csc room from last time - it has two screens and it\\'s hard to get a better room; i have so far no commitments for december so i trust your judgment to find good dates - please book it - just not too close to xmas . i think the blog post is great ! to be more clear: please find dec dates which are best for you and the csc room , thank you ! i\\'ll ask the room-bookers . did we have turku or tampere coming up in the horizon ? our plan says march 2018 turku but it can be changed if there is good motivation for it . so first half 2018 is likely to be right ? do we have a workshops-announce list or something like that ? or even an address (that isn\\'t <mailto:radovan . bast@uit . no|radovan . bast@uit . no> ) where people can request to be notified about workshops in a particular area ? how about cutomizing <https://source . coderefinery . org> with our own logo and text ? <https://docs . gitlab . com/ee/customization/branded_login_page . html> . <@u2b3dh142> that\\'s an ee feature . no wait it isn\\'t . dec 11-15 are all available atm . any preferences for mon-wed , tue-thu , wed-fri ? i\\'ll book it tomorrow morning so we can fix the dates . you have until then to comment . does anyone have photos from the stockholm workshop (and meeting) , or the copenhagen workshop ? if so could you upload the best one from each event to drive so i can use for the pdc newsletter ? < ! channel> i have tentatively booked monday december 11th to wednesday 13th for helsinki workshop . i\\'m open to moving it forward by a day or two if you find that more convenient . ok thanks for booking - i was offline yesterday afternoon - i would actually suggest tue-thu , it gives people the possibility to travel outside their weekends and also gives us the chance to meet and chat before the workshop . own branding would be cool if possible . sure . i\\'ll move the booking . i have photos from stockholm meetup , will upload soon . where can i find a decent quality png of the logo ? on the drive under logo/artwork . that was easier than i thought . the page is a bit hidden but can be found here <https://source . coderefinery . org/admin/appearance> . awesome ! (i am this week at a busy workshop in denmark but will catch up on things asynchronously) . i\\'ll also lock down the dates . and get the ball rolling . thanks ! also feel free to decide on dates for turku . i\\'d need to contact someone in turku for that . but hmm ... i think i might have a back channel to utu . i\\'ll ask . thank you jyry ! <@u21ph491q> the stockholm photos are now in the corresponding folder . hi every one , i am back . welcome back :slightly_smiling_face: nice that you made it :slightly_smiling_face: . all: please review this <http://coderefinery . org/repository/> - currently points to my email , later we will replace by a proper alias to decentralize information and effort . jyry: thanks for the notification via the gitlab desktop :slightly_smiling_face: it took a while until i understood it :slightly_smiling_face: . what\\'s a notification via gitlab desktop and did i do something ? anyway , there\\'s now a placeholder text on the login page . the \"radovan , this is an example\" banner . oh yeah right . i didn\\'t know it made a desktop notification as well . anyway , that\\'s the method for publishing notifications on the system . sorry no it didn\\'t bad wording by me . but that\\'s perfect . <@u23htrtjt> can you please add a link to <http://coderefinery . org/repository/> on the welcome screen of <https://source . coderefinery . org> ? are we ready to announce this (in beta) ? can anyone with an email create an account in the gitlab instance ? currently i think yes - so far no white-listing to my knowledge . ok . once we get a lot of spam (and we will get spam sooner or later) we probably need white-listing . ok we can get an email alias for the repo hosting support questions - who wishes to be behind that alias ? i will be there . i can participate . bast: i can also be in as i am not contributing much these days to the project . ok thanks - i will get you better involved , i will be back in neic work next week . <@u0kv7fvnv> you should be able to do so yourself at <https://source . coderefinery . org/admin/appearance> . jyrsa: ok thank you ! that\\'s even better . teach a man to fish^h^h^h^h update the front page ... exactly :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u0kv7fvnv> i asked internally for possible contacts at university of turku (utu) , will email them an ask about booking something for march-ish next year . or should i be more permissive in the schedule ? there\\'s no guarantee they can book rooms for the spring yet , it\\'s quite far away and regular teaching requirements typically override these extraneous requests . crazy idea: should we have a page that lists the requirements and preferred equipment in the teaching spaces ? then when contacting new universities we could link to that page . i think this is a super idea . i will create a document somewhere on the drive . perfect , later we can move it over to the website . <@u2k0egsc8> thanks for your work on mma lesson - we need to compress/distill a bit; in doubt i would focus only on pybind11 and cffi and only mention the pros/cons of other approaches . i will also soon streamline the cmake lesson further , i think the make pipeline start worked well in copenhagen . and i just remembered that i need to type up feedback from neic workshop; still in my bag . <@u0kv7fvnv> opinions on possibly expanding the time parameters for cr turku beyond just march ? i have nothing wrong with march but would like to be able to be flexible in negotiating if the university has preferences . yes , no problem to be more permissive , thanks ! what do you think <@u23htrtjt> ? can i let some beta users on the system ? sure . just no slashdot-effect please :slightly_smiling_face: . haha - ok we will start slow with word of mouth . also , there is a ci runner but i make no guarantees about how well it works for people . it\\'s on a separate vm so it shouldn\\'t become an attack vector on the gitlab proper . ok i will not advertise that one quite yet but i will test it soon , thanks ! the gitlab admin panel is cool ! sorry for bothering you in the past with questions that find their answers there . <@u2k0egsc8> i finally typed up the feedback . very good with all the comments in the repository , <@u21ph491q> &amp;&amp; <@u0kv7fvnv> . i get faster up to speed when remaking the first part of the mma lesson . . you can\\'t know which ones are fixable in the ui and which ones are configuration file things . good thing is that new users on source . coderefinery are external by default , this makes it easy to spot users who cannot create projects or groups (yet) - it also means that for external people joining projects we don\\'t have to do anything (but we should probably screen with email whitelisting) . <https://source . coderefinery . org> the favicon is not very friendly . could we have a small version of the coderefinery logo instead , please ? that\\'s the gitlab favicon - we can probably change it . the beta test user is supposed to burn in the eternal flames of pain .... ok , maybe just my interpretation . ;-) . not sure if we can change the favicon , i can look it up . imo this is not critical , i like the favicon and it is recognized as gitlab . i found the relevant feature request . people are doing workaround hacks to change the favicon . we can add it to the todo list . how can we solve the support line problem ? is there a lightweight request tracker ? i can get us an email alias but then we all get emails but still don\\'t know whether an issue is open or somebody works on it . that\\'s a very good question . we have an rt at csc and i think that\\'s pretty ... stone age . there\\'s a whole bunch of customer service services like zendesk . yeah rt is horrible . i would like something lightweight that does not push us down and adds to maintenance effort . also , if you want i think you can change the content of the confirmation emails . if you want to remind there that people need to send an extra application . ok good idea about customizing emails , thanks . it\\'s in the admin side . i am sorry i cannot see/find it - if you know where it is can you please point me to it ? <@u2k0z6mdg> and others: the in my opinion best way to contribute before our last workshop of this season is to fix issues , file pull request for changes , file new issues . <@u0kv7fvnv> i wasn\\'t able to find it either . there are however \"after sign up text\" and \"sign in text\" and i have no idea what they do . hi . bast: <@u0kv7fvnv> is there specific issues , are you taking in general . nothing in particular but we have accumulated a number of issues in the various lesson material; also reading through the material and submitting new issues or prs will be great help . jyrsa: ok i will test it out . bast: ok . good morning/noon everybody - amazing weather in tromso - 23 degrees last weekend; next week workshop , busy times as usual - looking forward to the summer break . nice , it\\'s raining now in helsinki but the weekend was clear skies and beautiful weather . long term forecast for tromso looks reasonably good - fingers crossed . is correct that there is no meeting today and the next meeting is on 14th . yes that is correct . those who teach next week: please verify today that <https://coderefinery . github . io/installation/> contains everything you will need in your sessions . this is our crowd next week: <https://radovan . typeform . com/report/yqdu4e/sqxv> . 1 person uses automated testing . has anybody time and know-how to create a vagrant or similar virtual machine that contains all the software that we need for next week ? motivation: make it easier for windows people to go through our material . hi guys , i was still on vacation yesterday (came back from crete in the afternoon) so couldn\\u2019t be here . now i\\u2019m back and will be working frantically on the documentation and jupyter sessions . i could try to create a vagrant environment with necessary software for workshop . however , i don\\u2019t have access to windows machine . so can\\u2019t really verify the problems encountered . but then it would be basically a linux machine - right ? yes ! but can\\u2019t test on the windows machine with vagrant environment to see everything is working as expected . i was thinking more along the lines of creating a virtualbox machine image . yes exactly (sorry for my possibly misleading wording) . reminder: today meeting 14:00 cest , 15:00 eest - please pre-fill agenda . and feel free to add additional meeting points , my brain is a sieve and huge packed drop problem . i am in the mwtacenter meeting in oslo today and i will join for 30 min . if you have difficulties joining but have questions or know of issues , please add them to the agenda , then at least there is some chance that we pick it up and solve/answer even if you guys cannot join . ok , i will join in sighlently and use chat the other 30 min . <@u5l3ena15> since you haven\\'t been at a video meeting before , this is our usual channel: <https://hangouts . google . com/hangouts/_/sn7rt3wmgvcxhn363xj3owg4iue> . <@u0kv7fvnv> ah , it looks like i have another video meeting at the same time for another project . ok no problem . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i\\u2019m in other workshop . so not able to attend the meeting . do you have these meetings regularly at this time on wednesdays ? i have another video meeting in this slot every second wednesday . nope . regularly on mondays but this monday there was something special . (it\\'s immediately after the da group weekly meeting because harsha and i asked for that) . ok . that is convenient then . :slightly_smiling_face: . actually the other way around , immediately before da meeting . this meeting slot was an exception - sorry for inconvenient time - for those who missed out , please consult the minutes: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1n9-na9xhfh8zsl5lqm471mih544zpgolbhlg4v3l64c/> - not everything is nicely formulated out so feel free to ask questions if things are unclear . <@u0kv7fvnv> you mentioned some examples of codes with good and bad documentation , do you have links ? ok we have to be careful that we don\\'t call some examples publicly \"bad\" so we have to be diplomatic in the material (i would show examples and let the audience decide what is good and bad) - good examples: <http://www . psicode . org/> , <https://docs . julialang . org/en/stable/> , <https://seaborn . pydata . org> - bad examples: <http://www . boost . org> , <http://daltonprogram . org/www/documentation . html> (this is a code i work on so shame on me but it has only a pdf file) , <http://octopus-code . org/wiki/main_page> (good code and doc but only latest version is documented by the virtue of mediawiki) . thanks ! yeah i\\u2019ll avoid calling things \\u201cbad\\u201d . in short , any documentation that does not have a version number or \"latest\" or \"stable\" in the url is suspicious . i disagree . documentation that says \"latest\" in the url means that it contains changes not yet in stable so i may accidentally code against a feature that isn\\'t released yet . happens to me all the time . i agree and understand - what i was more aiming at is to be suspicious about documentation that does not have any version information . <@u23htrtjt> have tested the after sign-up text - i think this is a good mechanism , this is a big in your face md-able text block that is visible after people click the \"registration\" button . bast: +1 for \"in your face\" . as i don\\'t think anything less will do . i am sure people will still find ways to overlook it but it\\'s better than before . no need for it to be foolproof . if people are ashamed at not having noticed a very visible notification then they\\'re unlikely to complain publicly about it . i think now it is fine to put on twitter even if we don\\'t have a support line so that we grow a bit , it will take time until this picks up and it may take until july before we have a proper zendesk , ok ? but i don\\'t want to rush us either so if you think it\\'s better to wait , we wait . no go ahead . i\\'ll have to put up some monitors on disk space usage somewhere so we\\'re not surprised . but even that doesn\\'t have to be in place . i am from time to time watching <https://source . coderefinery . org/admin/system_info> - at some point we should get weekly top 10 consumers or so and then i can do the follow up . as to the zendesk discussion yesterday: this will also be useful for questions about the course and software , now they go to me directly . send me some support requests to my demo account: <mailto:support@uit6019 . zendesk . com|support@uit6019 . zendesk . com> . just sent an email . thanks for testing - a minus is that emails notifications for me went directly into the spam folder - perhaps because of the spammy looking \"uit6019\" . \"uit\" is a sure sign of spam :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u21ph491q> in the doc section you can also demonstrate how we use these tools to do \"our\" things - this turned out to be motivating at the last workshop (got this via feedback after spending one sentence on this) . thanks for the tip . i\\u2019ve already added (and pushed) an exercise before the rtd gh-pages deployments , which is about creating sphinx documentation from scratch (this will be what we then deploy) , and it feels like there won\\u2019t be much time for more content . but one can always mention it . in general i think we should emphasize this in all section to make sure that people don\\'t think we teach just somebody else\\'s book but we really demo tools that we believe in ourselves . actually the admin ui can sort largest repos so this can possibly all be done over the web , nice . morning , anyone having couple of nice tromso pics i could reuse on social media to advertise the coming event ? nikolaid: sorry i don\\'t - i have some photos in different places but unfortunately badly organized and not accessible from here . <@u21ph491q> <https://www . eventbrite . com/e/workshop-on-sustainable-software-for-science-practice-and-experiences-wssspe51-wssspe-tickets-35168616278 ? aff=wssspe> . <@u0kv7fvnv> but isn\\u2019t the next physical sg meeting supposed to be all day at arlanda on sept 6 ? <@u21ph491q> indeed - cr*p - double-booked - the workshop is a must . <@u2234ay5a> :could not send photo (only one i have) as reply , but uploaded one \"troms . jpg\" not sure you see this on slack . thanks for spotting this - at the sg meeting i will find out whether people booked travel , if not then we probably need to find a new date . thanks for the photo <@u2k0z6mdg> but now this place looks very different at this time of the year :slightly_smiling_face: . bast: this is the only view i have seen , thought always like this . but does the target audience know ? most important thing in marketing is to enforce stereotypes . i like the way you think , sell what we want to sell , not what they want to buy . na - i will dig up some nice pic with lots of green and lots of sun :slightly_smiling_face: . random friday afternoon thoughts . should we have some kind of an announce-list or a way for people to subscribe to notifications about the opening of sign-up of a particular workshop ? or do we already ? is there an excel sheet for this <@u0kv7fvnv> ? thanks harsha . <@u23htrtjt> can we just use the google group ? i thought a bit about a mailinglist before . in the bioexcel project managed here from pdc all previous attendants to their webinars get registered to a mailinglist , on which newsletters and other occasional emails are sent . if people don\\u2019t like it there\\u2019s a link in every email to opt out . i thought we should perhaps have this as well , but of course previous participants are not the optimal audience for workshop announcements . i don\\'t know if there is a low-effort alternative to the button that online stores have that says \"email me when this product is available\" . hmm , no i dont know either . so , regarding the jupyter session in troms\\xf6 . i\\u2019m going to try something new: after showing the slides and going through the first intro lesson , i\\u2019ll let the learners split into groups . one group will work on and discuss data analysis (using the notebook) , another one on python acceleration , the third is a discussion group to talk about possible use cases the learners can think of , and the last group is for those who want to research other use cases . any comments on how sensible this is ? currently if somebody is interested , i note it down in a doc close to the workshop on the drive so that i don\\'t forget and email them personally later - then people can follow twitter (but of course it is easy to miss things) and can subscribe to the mailing list - the mailing list was initially meant as q&amp;a but it is not really used - i guess it is not too much spam to announce things over this list and it is opt-in; i like \"email me when this product is available\" solutions that some website have and if somebody would like to set it up then green light but i am personally completely maxed out so i have to postpone this for some time . better solutions than my pedestrian doc help are very welcome . <@u2k0egsc8> again slow progress on my side on cmake/mma due to meeting festival - i plan to do a full iteration on both tonight and tomorrow . if we moved the website away from a static website to an actual server with some code running behind it , we could easily implement a \"notify me once this opens\" field . <@u0kv7fvnv> maybe you could use a service like mailchimp (<https://mailchimp . com>) . they have a free tier too . hmm - yes , in fact i have experimented with mailchimp for workshop registrations . and that was the moment when the weather turned bad - sadly bad forecast until <https://www . yr . no/place/norway/troms/troms%c3%b8/troms%c3%b8/long . html> . couldn\\'t you have arranged better weather ?! i\\'ve checked into hotel comfort xpress , and i see now how comes their rates are so low ... . so hotel no good ? no its fine , just breakfast not included (one can get a \"discount\" at another hotel , 150 nok per breakfast) and only one cleaning and new towels all week . but room is good and wifi seems stable . ok - i am now at the university hacking my sessions for tomorrow but if you like we could meet later for some light dinner or drink . sure , what time suits you ? i was thinking of semi-early dinner , hardly had any lunch . 18:30 at your hotel ? too late ? too early ? not that\\u2019s perfect ! do you live nearby ? if it\\u2019s easier i can come somewhere . i live nearby but university is a bit further away so i will come by bus to the city anyway . ok . dear all , please verify this: <http://bit . ly/coderefinery-tromso> - please add info that i might have forgotten . for those who are not busy with workshop: please brainstorm about ways how we can collect feedback on our service , website , lessons , and workshop (for the latter thor has done good work already , please take it as starting point) - we could use google analytics (ga) but i would prefer open and transparent , non-intrusive , brief feedback (ga is behind the curtains and feeds data to a company that has too much money already) . big thanks to <@u2b3dh142> for creating a virtual box image for the course ! i will tomorrow share the link with the participants . ahh , i\\'m also at the comfort xpress . will you guys be needing my help in the afternoon ? i\\'m currently at the hotel and will need at least some time to put finishing touches on tomorrow\\'s session and to actually try through all the tricks with pycharm ce (because i personally use the professional edition) . i think we are fine , no need to come up here - we plan to go for a run around 6 pm if you want to join . sure , the scenery looks promising at least . ok we can then meet at the hotel , thor will join , bjoern probably too , me too . for people at the workshop - lessons learned: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1xvt9eglbnkmovaaht72wzvysd0w_1gffazcleoasqmy/> . at what time was the afternoon coffee break today ? also when are you meeting for the run ? <@u23htrtjt> let\\'s meet as soon as possible in the lobby of xpress , radovan and bj\\xf6rn will come here . kk . in running clothes or regular clothes ? <@u5l3ena15> can you please add yourself here: <http://coderefinery . org/team/> ? sources: <https://github . com/coderefinery/coderefinery . org> - thanks ! <@u23htrtjt> do you have some cheatsheet for the ide session ? i could print it tomorrow morning . i was going to go mostly by \"search for action\" and \"if you search for it for more than three times you should remember the shortcut\" . but i can assemble the commands <@u2234ay5a> has listed in a document in gdocs or a markdown table or something . no rush if we don\\'t have something but if you have some document then i can print it but if not , we do it next time . well i did create this out of the commands used in the tutorial <https://docs . google . com/spreadsheets/d/1tst8wrjrxwit0xpoya3u8getdvieyqp6zbtljkv_2o0/edit#gid=0> . feedback now typed up in the workshop folder . one concrete request was to have a quick recap tomorrow morning of git . isn\\'t that essentially the whole morning session ? no the comment was to recap what was learned today . before moving on , i assume . that is actually important . ok thanks , i will recap . <@u23htrtjt> your session looks good and don\\'t use my comment here to implement any changes but i am not convinced about technically merging ide and testing into one repo - it is good to teach them together as you will but now we have code duplication and divergence risk - again , don\\'t change anything now , we can talk about it and fix it later . the other problem with it is that it bakes these topics together - we may want to franchise either the ide or the testing lesson and people may want to give them separately and then it may be confusing for participants to see the other topic that is not covered - but keep as it is for tomorrow . i agree . also , the concepts can be mixed and if i had the time i\\'d streamline the main points more . but trying something for the first time gives the best feedback on whether or not it works . but don\\'t worry about it now , do your thing and your style , i am sure it will be great , later we streamline more . but in retrospect a talk-mostly testing repo and a talk-and-do-trivialities repo and then a do-mostly repo would be a good mix . with clearly defined interfaces beween the three so that the first two give the prerequisites for the third . yes , i like the interfaces idea - they should become modules/ building blocks . the reason why i objected is that for instance lex wanted me/us to give the git collab and testing session only , then it\\'s nice if they are separate blocks . but that\\'s really what\\'s difficult in this all , defining what is the core and how much of the core can be reliably thought in x minutes . yes - it\\'s really hard , continous improvement , i have given the git talk \"million\" times and still today i found some parts of my session really not good . plus the super challenge of controlling/predicting prerequisite information . super hard , and then every time different audience - it\\'s like stand-up comedy - some good jokes suddenly don\\'t work . today i read a good quote: \"video game theory: if there are no enemies you are on wrong way . \" . that\\'s why i really felt for the stand-up comedian at neic gala dinner . super-hard audience . he did pretty good though but i could tell he was struggling at times . he did a great job , computer geeks and policy makers , tough crowd . should defining the interface structure be on thursday\\'s agenda ? <@u23htrtjt> for the cheatsheet please create me a pdf and i will print it over lunch break , thank you (time too tight for me to convert from excel to pdf , tried that but then things got printed across pages) . bast: <https://drive . google . com/drive/folders/0b3i0zrreqpsxuc1ku1q0ognaqkk> . surprisingly difficult that even with the simplified google tools . <@u2k0egsc8> i found a cool exercise (i think) that will connect nicely to your hello world example - cmake-ify <https://github . com/gregwar/ascii-tetris> - it\\'s easy , requires only few adaptations and is fun - i will add it to the material but feel free to not consider it . <@u2k0egsc8> <https://coderefinery . github . io/cmake/04-exercise/> . cool ! i like it . <@u23htrtjt> got this feedback yesterday: \\u201chope for a workflow repeat/recap/schematic for reference on this topic . maybe a bulletpoint list on what travis/coveralls is etc . \\u201d . ok . feedback from yesterday now typed up in workshop folder . ha-ha , figured out what was probably the issue with coveralls yesterday: i\\'m not authorized for coveralls usage for the coderefinery project (<@u0kv7fvnv> you probably got a request via email) . i don\\'t suppose <@u21ph491q> or <@u2k0egsc8> would also have admin privileges on coveralls ? <@u0kv7fvnv>: did you ever think within the project about a more common support channel for the previous alumni ? is there a need ? do you get questions via email after the workshops from some of the participants ? we have a google group , but it\\'s not particularly active . coveralls issue is now fixed . yes we are thinking about a support channel , we think about zendesk but other ideas very welcome . what\\'s wrong with rt ? super bloated , slow , basically unusable search function , maintenance effort , too many features for what we need . plus no easy way to publish answers to questions as a part of a knowledgebase (that i know of) . <@u0kv7fvnv> i am outside your office . i am in the coffee place (workshop building) . (we will have a meeting room in the workshop building) . there was an investigation on alternatives for rt by uninett (although fram support ended up using rt) , may be the report of this would be worth having a look . i will see whether i can find out if anyone at uio involved in it . thanks ! we need to get the zendesk or similar up soon , see <https://twitter . com/coderefine/status/878569302177263617> . travelling - on the way to a conference . is there a meeting call today ? i\\'m held up all day teaching . yes - we meet now weekly with hopefully shorter meetings; whoever can , joins - those who travel/vacation/teach , good luck and enjoy , respectively . edit: roughly weekly - next week for instance i am gone . also if ever you are unsure about meetings you can go to latest meeting minutes which is either already the prepared agenda for the upcoming meeting which has the date in its title or is the last held meeting which will contain the date of the next . if the flight reach without delay i will join . for those who cannot join (in case flight is not on time): pre-fill the agenda with your observations , road blocks , questions , etc . and also post-process the minutes after the meeting to stay informed; i believe we can do actually quite a lot also asynchronously . i can\\'t join the meeting today , travelling back to sweden from uk weekend holiday . sorry late notice . ok - please check minutes: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1j0s0_qtv8tzg7izftcyu2ljuohkhoignq4g-0dl8cvu/> . as to zendesk: internet recommends also this as zendesk\\'s more lightweight cousin: <https://www . groovehq . com> . gitlab statistics: 31 users , 26 projects , 8 groups , 37 issues . should we have a \"days since major incidents\" sign somewhere ? <@u23htrtjt>: should this attract the users or getting them aware of the beta status ? yes , like on construction sites :slightly_smiling_face: i like it . i\\'ve always found them somewhat looming . so the second . ;-) looming is a good word . we don\\'t have to show that to the users . maybe automate some kind of slack bot . it can be for us - we had that in the pdc support room at it was quite funny (number of days since last support request) . then we should also introduce employee of the month picture frames :slightly_smiling_face: . ooh , i wonder if we can have those on slack . <@u0kv7fvnv>: how do we seek support from coderefinery folks regarding hosted projects ? hosted in gitlab , that is . <@u075ur7j4> currently it\\'s through me :slightly_smiling_face: <http://coderefinery . org/repository/support/> - we will very soon set up a proper email support/ticketing line . <@u075ur7j4> also there is useful info here <http://coderefinery . org/repository/> . thanx ! sorry i can\\'t make it to the meeting today as i have a physical meeting on top . i would however like to set up a deadline for myself to draft a more language-neutral hands-on oriented introduction to testing by say ... early september . but we can discuss that next monday . if you have any gitlab issues you know how to reach me . according to the last meeting minutes our next meeting is july 17 , and there wasn\\u2019t one today either ! ahh , right . just in time before my holiday then . <@u23htrtjt> imo we should motivate testing in less than 15 mins in a language neutral way; then let us assume that people are convinced about testing - the next hurdle is in my experience the \"how\" - imo we then need to show language-specific examples but we should offer examples that work in the top 4 popular languages - i think that if we remain too abstract , we might not get the message across (but as always i welcome different views on this than mine) . it would be nice if we manage to get a design element into the hands-on so that people think about how to create a test and get the whole machinery running - i imagine that we will pair up people by languages (c , c++ , fortran , python , ruby , matlab) . gitlab runs to my knowledge completely smooth; some more documentation to do and i will take care of that . <@u23htrtjt> please refresh my memory: have we exercised a complete gitlab disaster scenario where the service is gone and all we have are backups - have we exercised that we are able to reconstruct the service from our backups ? also we should start thinking about off-site backups - i can probably find some space in tromso , we just need to figure out how we do it . as to meetings: since there is typically confusion on when is the next meeting i decided that i will send a reminder at least one day before - this will of course not prevent competing events , in case you have missed the last meeting: to block your calendars please see latest past meeting minutes which contain next date and time . we will keep every monday 12:00 cest , 13:00 eest except when i am traveling as is the case this monday and next monday . <@u0kv7fvnv> i disagree . large parts of the mind set in \"how\" are also non-language-specific . e . g . you have a function that takes in two numbers , what things would you have to test about it (either or both being zero , either or both being negative , etc) and also being aware of floating point inaccuracies . or even better the classical case of reversing a list: what are the things you need to test for in a function that reverses a list ? (an empty list , a list with odd number of elements and a list with even number of elements and possibly a large list for performance) . <@u0kv7fvnv> and we have run a recovery test . the only issue was with permissions of one of the tarballs and i\\'ve written that down somewhere . we can fairly easily use the same ansible playbook a static backup host somewhere else assuming it\\'s running centos 7ish . ok thanks for reminding me about the recovery . as to testing we can add an exercise or discussion which is language-independent but i think it is important that we stay down to earth and try to meet the participants where they are - we can use pseudo-code but sparsely; for me the goals of the testing lesson are: 1) understand why to test , 2) know how to test , 3) know how to approach a function that needs a new test . i think we need an exercise in the testing session which connects to the language people use so that they can take that as a starting point after the workshop . i would really like to have an example there which makes sense in all c , c++ , fortran , python , matlab , and r and provide examples for all of them . <@u23htrtjt> one thing i would like to ask you to do before we develop the testing lesson further is to re-split the ide-testing lesson and apply changes to the corresponding isolated repos; after that feel free to file prs with ideas; to prevent that ideas that cost a lot of work get slashed late , you can open an issue briefly explaining what you would like to do so that we can discuss things before a lot of work goes into it . there\\'s a reason i didn\\'t take over either but made a new repo . ok - i just want to avoid that we lose your good work; if we have things in two places , one will be left behind . excellent read: <http://third-bit . com/teaching/> . <@u23htrtjt> i have today a call with the deic representative about gitlab hosting , will inform you after - do you know when risto is back from vacation ? <@u0kv7fvnv> on the 16th of july according to our absence calendar . jyrsa: thanks ! <@u23htrtjt> - we got an imo very reasonable offer from deic for gitlab hosting; i need to run it past the steering group but if approved we would migrate data in september and once we are happy with the new instance , we would relocate the url to point to the new one . great ! we need to somehow streamline the administration of courses , it is really quite an effort to arrange room , website , registrations , and also certificates - currently very centralized . for those who are not on vacation: (probably short) meeting tomorrow (monday) 12 cest/ 13 eest . im on vacation until end of this month , plus a couple of days in august , and cant attend tomorrow . enjoy ! ack . i changed the meeting google doc name from 2017-07-16 to 2017-07-17 , i trust google should take care of refactoring if it is linked from elsewhere . thanks - yes , links are preserved afaik . letsencrypt updated so it\\'s valid until october . excellent - thank you ! in retrospect i should have documented what i did . but i\\'d expect to have to do this just once more . :slightly_smiling_face: . :eyes: . hi sabry and everybody who is around: hope you had a good weekend ! yes , hope the same with you as well . i finally finished my paragliding course - we had wonderful weather here and i could get many flights done; now back to coderefinery work . sounds exciting , not something i would attempt unless i had to . it\\'s incredibly much fun . i will take your word for it . for those who are not on vacation: (probably short) meeting at 12:00 cest , 13:00 eest - agenda (please edit): <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1sodxyhdidyki_0lh4ubdebthhi2bvkdf27xl_0j6et4/> . ack . we absolutely need a feature where people can sign up to get updates on courses , got contacted by a person from dtu who is super interested and did not hear about our workshop we gave at dtu . maybe just a simple form with a drop-down and an email address ? and a process that we announce by email 1 day before going public . exactly - already something as simple as that will get us very far . i got a contact about booking the venue in turku . will try to get back to them next week . can we generate a couple of preferences by then ? super ! thank you ! we meet on monday on video and can fix dates then . :sun_with_face: . good morning team ! hope you\\u2019ve all had a good summer . can you be more specific about the term \"good\" . i believe there\\u2019s no universal definition of \\u201cgood\\u201d . always in the eye of the beholder ! then it was good . that\\u2019s what matters :slightly_smiling_face: . mine was good too , we did less travelling and active vacationing than usual but that was relaxing . good morning everybody - also here good summer , spending lots of time outside to recharge . <@u0kv7fvnv> how did your umbraphilic trip go ? you may need to google that term :wink: . indeed learned a new word :slightly_smiling_face: the trip starts after tomorrow . today meeting 12:00 cest/ 13:00 eest - <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1dd7nj8lcomwn0cusspazp_cfpzz3vdp-uvl-ffdytfu/> . i might be 5-10 minutes late to the meeting due to the pdc summer school which i\\u2019m helping out with . <@u0kv7fvnv> i was inspired to finally update the workflow exercise to support group names (and not just numbers) and to add another script that tests the tweets for length <https://github . com/coderefinery/forking-workflow-exercise/tree/add_travis> . not sure if the . travis . yml will work out of the box though . that\\'s awesome ! you can then also close <https://github . com/coderefinery/forking-workflow-exercise/issues/55> i guess . i\\'m not 100% if i\\'m an admin for the repo and organization in travis so could i trouble you to enable travis for the repo ? now enabled . great . we will also need to rewind master back to pre-workshop state before merging to master . apparently i don\\'t have admin privileges (just write) on the repo . or alternately i\\'m just blind and can\\'t find the settings . but now it\\'s fine right ? or is there an action you would like to do and are not allowed to ? just set that the travis build must pass before merging to master is permitted . no wait , i just didn\\'t see it . <http://blog . recurity-labs . com/2017-08-10/scm-vulns> (thanks to petter for posting this on <#c0mtddd27|web>) . <@u0kv7fvnv> i have created initial draft for reproducible research session . just now filed a pull request . lot of work is still pending . if it is acceptable in the current state you can accept it . i will be away (holiday + parental vacation) for six weeks starting from thursday . perfect - thank you harsha ! i will have a look and give feedback (in form of issues) asap . have a nice vacation ! <@u0kv7fvnv> , i have another telco on top of this week\\'s status meeting . no progress on the space for turku workshop . i looked into how csc employees can obtain a report on their hours logged for this project so they can ask me if they don\\'t want to figure it out themselves . cool ! <@u23htrtjt> have you thought about the talk sept 14 ? absolutely no pressure to commit to it i am only asking for two reasons: 1) to give people the opportunity to take some challenges and not monopolize things myself and 2) because i need to fix flights around that date so i need to decide . fyi the eussi (design study for a european software sustainability infrastructure for research) proposal that we have contributed to some time ago , unfortunately got rejected (<@u0a9nv7px>); however the report is encouraging for future calls/proposals . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i\\'d be more than happy to go . i just don\\'t want to rob you of an interesting day in copenhagen . <@u23htrtjt> - perfect ! i will be indeed very happy if you can go to that workshop and give that talk (i will provide you with all info that you need of course) - this will help me a lot; more details in an email in a moment . also good news about aarhus workshop - managed to get in contact with people who want to help us planning things - more details soon . < ! channel> (those under contract): please provide me via email or direct messages with estimates about your contributions to this project (hours or days or percentages) since march 2017 before coming friday , september 1st - thank you ! hey , what a great day , the weather is modestly warm and the summer is almost over , everyone are back from holidays ! yes , what a great day , indeed . met mr winter on storsylen on saturday , ice and fog , the magnificent view totally obscured by clouds . the descent was like walking in the neic introductory video . ack . great ! my vacation is turning to an end - looking forward to see you all soon . is this including march or not including march ? including march (beginning of march was the last time we collected such info) . hi all . it\\u2019s time to pick up on the planning for the link\\xf6ping workshop in november . according to my local contacts in link\\xf6ping there shouldn\\u2019t be any other major events that we have to avoid colliding with . but i need to know our constraints , what week in november suits us best ? for my part early november would be best . thanks ! all my nov after nov 5 is free for me . ideally tue-thu (keeps weekend free of travels) . we have hpc training november 1 , 2 and 3 , if there is any contribution from me then need to avoid those dates . ok , thanks for input . how about aarhus workshop oct 11-13 ? (there is a swc workshop oct 9-10) . unfortunately these are the worst possible dates for me in october . ok , should we aim for late oct ? but of course it\\u2019s not essential that i attend . late oct would also give more time to adapt material , sept is already quite full for me with meetings . for me to be able to attend yes , the rest of october (except 16th when we have ume\\xe5) are free . one option could be oct 18-20 , another oct 24-26 . either work for me , but oct 24-26 sticks to the tue-thur principle so maybe preferable . ok , nov 7-9 (tue-thurs) in link\\xf6ping looks good to the local people there . shall we fix it ? agree - i will check room availability for oct 24-26 . yes , let\\'s do that . thank you ! i don\\u2019t remember the latest on a requirements list for workshop venues , is there a tentative list somewhere ? i can work on it and put on our website . my memory is not good but i think we wanted to create such a list but never did - it would be great to have it online to make communication with local organizers easier (often they have to ask other people who ask other people and it is easier to send a link) . exactly . actually i found this <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1r8dfqrn8emmdrnwqjs3djpqug-d7pv6vjxtbt31pp4u/edit> . cool :slightly_smiling_face: my memory is indeed awful . clearly written after the dtu workshop :slightly_smiling_face: . we have following workshop dates fixed: aarhus oct 24-26 , linkoeping nov 7-9 , espoo dec 12-14 . i will announce today over twitter . also i will implement the please-contact-me-about-nearby-workshops form today or tomorrow . great ! yes - now i remember again . i am sorry to cancel our monday meeting sep 4 , my flight to norway got moved over our meeting; meeting moved to one week later (sep 11) - we will coordinate things here over slack . is the updated \\u201cformal requirements\\u201d list on the above drive link sufficient ? ok . looks very good - thanks . <@u0kv7fvnv> 339 hours sofar this year , 258 . 5 since march . thanks ! <@u0kv7fvnv>: 173 hours since march 1 (today included) . thanks ! sorry for this stupid question but how many working hours are in one month in norway ? actually strike that - it depends on public holidays so it is not so easy . <@u23htrtjt> <@u21ph491q> can you please send me links to the articles you wrote ? (for the mid-term report; i mean links on the web , not our drive) . <https://www . pdc . kth . se/news/news-repository/coderefinery-workshop-in-espoo> . <https://www . pdc . kth . se/events/event-repository/coderefinery-gettogether-2017> . sorry not the last one , that\\u2019s the event announcement . thank you ! here\\u2019s the pdc newsletter which has an article: <https://www . pdc . kth . se/newsletter/2017-1/pdc-newsletter-2017-no . -1> . found the csc one . and in the 2016 newsletter there was also a newsletter: <https://www . pdc . kth . se/newsletter/2016-2/pdc-newsletter-2016-no . -2> . super - thanks . forgot about the threading\\u2026 . it\\'s no problem - i started to use it to make it easier for others to follow and skip messages (my hope is that more people then actually read here :-) . as annoying as it is for me to write the report , it is good to get organized - i see now better that we have done quite a lot and also see more clearly where to focus efforts . sounds good ! it\\u2019s like research proposals , annoying at first but then one starts getting ideas . yes exactly . please check this form: <https://docs . google . com/forms/d/e/1faipqlse5-uqyykagj5dqg2vxuzspd7rm5kzw_gfbopwzz7g5khbowq/viewform> - anything else we need to ask ? any suggestions for changes ? google drive tells me this url is wrong\\u2026 . sorry my bad - have fixed the url . looks very good . thanks - simple but hopefully effective; will announce it today since people don\\'t want to miss workshops but they also don\\'t want to check our website twice a week (understandably) . if you go here <https://www . timeanddate . no/kalkulator/arbeidsdager> . thanks ! you get how many workdays there is . this year its 226 , i think . <@u0kv7fvnv>: soundproblems in the browser . google analytics for the websites ! hm ? :slightly_smiling_face: . i hope you all had a nice weekend - today\\'s meeting moved to a week later since i am traveling today . can i ask you to please review <https://coderefinery . github . io/mma/> which i will present end of this week ? it has been significantly shortened and all suggestions are most welcome (prs , issues , even suggestions to revert the shortening) . only up to \"using the c foreign function interface for python\" (including) will be covered in the manchester workshop . <@u2b3dh142> i did not forget to review your contributed slides , will do so very soon . good morning team . weekend was nice here in stockholm , went to the botanical garden yesterday with parents-in-law , but today autumn seems to have arrived . regarding the separation into \\u201cworkshops\\u201d and \\u201cevents\\u201d on our website . shouldn\\u2019t the ume\\xe5 and manchester events go under the \\u201cevents\\u201d category , so that we keep the \\u201cworkshop\\u201d label only for the traditional 3-day workshops ? good morning ! summer arrived in trondheim yesterday . had a bicycle ride with old friends from the student days . very enjoyable . seems summer has left again today , though . i hear that further up north the weather is better . we can not complain much on weather when considering the floods in asia . i didn\\'t know texas was a part of asia now :stuck_out_tongue: . texas is not a part of this earth , it is usa . i meant <http://www . abc . net . au/news/2017-08-31/india-nepal-bangladesh-floods-monsoon-rains/8858858> . wow , i had totally missed this . talk about a west-oriented world vie . it is indeed interesting how little media exposure it got , always just a side note . also , texas is kind of less a part of the usa than the other states because it has the right to unilaterally secede from the union . i am thinking of getting he \"essential\" plan on <https://www . zendesk . com/product/pricing/> - 5 usd/agent; how many agents should we get ? i am thinking 4 agents , one of them me . do you think we should get more ? how should we distribute them ? my tentative thought was: sabry , thor , somebody from csc , and me - later once gitlab/ci is running on deic infrastructure we would add denmark . but perhaps you have better ideas . can we just have \"joe csc\" ? or do they have to be tightly bound to individuals ? or is it better to have them tightly bound to individuals . we could also share accounts but that has the small disadvantage that ownership is then less clear unless we track it manually in comments . and 4 zendesk agents would not mean that only the 4 do the work but we would have 4 people who are able to track the work but could offload it to anybody . sounds reasonable to me . i also bet this hurricane will get less coverage than harvey: <http://www . bbc . com/news/world-latin-america-41156051> . a little visual revamp: <http://coderefinery . org> - my goal is to make more clear what we do and why and also mention software carpentry , ssi , etc . <@u0kv7fvnv>: can you make the neiclogo picture larger in y direction , otherwise it looks strange on the mobile phone . also two logos on one row is confusing to me . on the index page or on the partner page ? ok i will rework it . also there is 0 whitespace between the logos when viewing on a mobile device . also please precise \"strange\" . did you fix this already ? looks ok on my android . except for the fact that it touches the coderefinery logo . thanks , need to fix that . haven\\'t fixed anything so i am not sure what is broken (apart from zero margin and the fact of having two logos next to each other) . sent a screen shot from my mobile . also , looking at a full-screen screen shot on the gallery app mobile device can lead to confusion :slightly_smiling_face: . i confirm that screen (i normally check chrome devel tools and shrink the screen size , but was tired yesterday to make it better) . i have a good contact in aarhus who helps me organizing things . i will need to set up a workshop page by tonight to get it into newsletters . please think whether you wish to participate in the workshop (oct 24-26) . i also expect r people - would be good if we could offer them a talk by an expert . <@u0kv7fvnv>: as <@u23htrtjt> already pointed out: \"there is 0 whitespace between the logos when viewing on a mobile device\" , this is what i meant with strange . ok that will be fixed . aarhus workshop registration is open (email newsletters in aarhus go out tomorrow and it\\'s really super good if people can register once they click the link , otherwise the workshop gets forgotten) . changed the website layout again: <http://coderefinery . org> . based on internal discussion r experts and people who know about software development are sets that don\\'t overlap too much . but there must be somebody who has expertise in both :slightly_smiling_face: would be good to invite her/him to give a 45 mins show . looks good ! but more vertical space seems to be needed , this is how it looks by default in my browser (looks better after zooming out) . maybe i\\u2019ve set a zoomed-in setting in my browser . try ctrl and minus . oh i know it looks fine when zoomed out , it\\u2019s just that when i open the page the heading is partially blocked . still blocked ? i think this is the right layout . when you zoom in the menu should rearrange as <@u21ph491q> observed . so when the zoom is much higher or the screen to text size ratio goes up , the menu should disappear behind a expansion item . this is expected to happen on mobile with a touch interaction . the alternative , make the text smaller or overlap is a verse solution imo . no it\\u2019s looks good nwo . *now . we have a paid typeform account now , right ? so can we share registration forms ? yes but the aarhus one goes still through my personal one - reason is that it had to be ready yesterday and i ran out of time to move it to the paid one (i have contacted typeform support and it is possible to move forms) - everything after the aarhus one is on the paid one; small restriction: we have the cheaper of the two paid ones so we cannot actually share forms unless we share the account , which we will probably need to do - it is way too much work for me alone . i don\\'t have a good recipe for sharing boring and super urgent work and curiously i seem to have a lot of boring and super urgent work which i end up doing myself since i feel bad offloading it or i feel i don\\'t have time documenting it - classic problem . reward yourself by offloading stuff after you\\'ve documented it . that\\'s the right strategy - i need to work in a more long-term oriented way . will try to move the aarhus form to the paid account . i have added a question to the registration form to select sessions the registrant is most interested in , we can use it to possibly adapt the schedule better to the audience to avoid: . also i have boldly added modular code development and software licensing to the aarhus schedule - hopefully we can pull it off; also i meant to add reproducibility but forgot but we should have it there . in year from now we will start on a project proposal for cr 2 . 0 . i think it is worthwhile to already start thinking &amp;&amp; discussing now what to expect in cr 2 . 0 . we pick up and generate new ideas on topics and way to present stuff more or less continuously . radovan has mention licensing and md code development . thor experienced software carpentry use of zoom , with group discussions . one idea i liked was adapting kanban for use in research-software projects . this was mention by radek lonka , ntnu , a participant at the troms\\xf8 workshop . i have read a few chapters about kanban . one of its\\u2019 major principles is \\u201cstop starting and start finishing\\u201d . imo coderefinery should embrace this principle (and break the principle at once by starting to use kanban - ha ha :laughing:) i suggest ideas that expand coderefinery we move to cr 2 . 0 , either ideas are about wider outreach or expanding the curriculum . ideas that improve the quality of content and our ability on \\u201cdelivery\\u201d , like the text on teach that radovan passed around in the summer , we implement/refine in the current project . already we have a lot of stuff/ideas which is relevant for cr 2 . 0 . if we focus on getting better at what we currently are doing , we will be unstoppable by the end of next year . suggest we discuss this on monday . great ideas - let us discuss this on monday - can you please create an agenda (copy previous meeting agenda and adapt) and add this to the agenda ? the timing is perfect since this will be discussed at neic board meeting sept 21 . i will make an agenda . thanks ! since we\\'re brainstorming: could we have a docker registry of some sort alongside the version control ? then we could offer multiple parts of the puzzle of making experiments repeatable: 1) the (versioned) code and 2) the (versioned) environment in which to run the data ? obviously this lacks the third leg of data , but access to research data is waaaay outside the scope of coderefinery imo . docker stuff would be good in the reproducibility part , i would personally not like to couple version control lesson with docker to not introduce too many things in one place where people struggle enough to understand vc already - but it is my personal opinion and ok to overrule me :slightly_smiling_face: . reminder: meeting monday 12:00 cest/ 13:00 eest - we have quite a full and interesting agenda (please edit and complete; cheers to bjoern for setting it up): <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1sqwnzisv5buvenovf_e_vafkdxyejowxackgkyqmvjg/> . good morning all . good morning ! slow weekend , doing stuff in the house and on the house . smell of autumn in the air &amp;&amp; wearing gloves during bicycle ride to work this morning . i\\'d like to represent version control and reproducible environments as two legs of a three-legged chair . with the third one being data access . no need to do any strong coupling . i still feel microbes crawling inside my skull . back to work , with sub optimal efficiency . and i can take this opportunity to brag about running a half marathon on saturday ! hope you get better soon sabry . thank you . kudos to you , <@u21ph491q> . congrats for the half marathon ! here leaves are turning yellow , first day in office since many weeks . ok now i understand better - thanks - lessons should be loosely coupled in the sense that they should make sense on their own and also not overload concepts but it is nice if there is a overarching narrative to it . nice , how did you do ? i have one coming up this saturday . good luck with that <@u23htrtjt> . i reached my goal , which was under 1:40 . nice , that\\'s a good time . yeah i wasn\\u2019t sure how it would go , since i\\u2019ve been preparing for a different race all summer . i meant to do a hilly 30km race , which would of course be much slower , so i hadn\\u2019t trained for speed as much . oh yeah , it must be already quite cold up there . the sipoonkorpi national park was really warm this weekend , ~15 degrees day and night . got a chance to try my gore-tex clothes with all the rain . but external circumstances make me miss the 30km one , so i spontaneously signed up for the half marathon . for today\\'s meeting: we have a lot of material - please take some time to browse material ahead of the meeting . pls update . still at desk , may be a few minutes late . first registrations for aarhus are rolling in , good . great ! something started today: 6 registrations in . how\\'s the r emphasis looking ? <@u0kv7fvnv> i got tips about two potential r people who might also have an understanding of software engineering principles . happily one of them is actually from turku so i\\'ll just contact him and advertise the turku workshop already . excellent ! do we have dates set ? <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/utm0nu/q4v424klb8scizry> . nope . i\\'ll ping the contact again . it has to do with when they decide their course schedules for the spring term . handy . ok no problem , we have time , just wanted to check whet i did not forget something . so far only one r developer , let\\'s see . apparently i\\'ve last contacted them a month ago so a new email was due . also , i promised two scientist members of our team that they can hang in the background of the december helsinki workshop if they bring their own chairs and laptops . that\\'s completely fine but it is important that we get them into our statistics; we get evaluated by numbers . sure , they are also both women so we get more equality points . although i haven\\'t found that to be an issue so far . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u21ph491q> is the ume\\xe5 workshop on monday or tuesday ? <http://coderefinery . org/events/2017-10-16-umea/> also the page says \"friday , october 16\" which clearly can\\'t be true . so far nobody asked me about gender . total number and disciplines seems to matter . as soon as we close registration we will ask them to register just to get them into the system . til margaret thatcher was more proud of having become the first prime minister with a science degree than the first female prime minister . i am assuming monday but was silently surprised that it is monday - to be confirmed by thor . it was listed as oct 17th in the minutes but that\\'s within typo range . aarhus oct 24-26 planning <@u21ph491q> <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u2k0egsc8> (please reply in the thread to keep things together) . i am thinking that sabry could do git intro and perhaps ide (which would be shrunk) ? bj\\xf8rn: cmake . fine . bj\\xf8rn could also take ide if that is interesting for you . thor: git collab , doc , jupyter . yes , i have use clion a bit . not very different from pycharm . me: testing , licensing , modular stuff and whatever is left . you put bindings on hold ? i would like to change the ide session to have the goal to motivate and demo ides but where the tool does not matter (we could have examples in 2 different tools) . unsure about the bindings , if we run out of time with the other things we could put it in , otherwise it might be too much but we have it there in our pockets and can use it at late notice . like eclipse vs pycharm , a bit heavy perhaps . for ide: 2-3 demos of things which are easy in an ide and hard without but the tool should not matter . debugging is certainly much handier in a ide than outside\\u2026 what was that command of gdb again\\u2026 . in ide it is at your finger tips . so if you feel like it bj\\xf8rn , you can also take ide session . imo there is some work to be done on the ide . the cmake works as it is but can use simplification . i want to schedule it now so that we have time and don\\'t need to panic at the last moment - in which both we and the lessons and attendants suffer . i can sign up for the ide &amp;&amp; cmake . great ! i will create some trello cards - please read feedback from past workshops for inspiration and i recommend to make the ide less language and tool-dependent , maybe even consider make it as demo where people lean back and watch , up to you - but we need to change it , was too difficult to follow and too python-centric . nice , my old bachelor\\'s thesis advisor from turku responded and is willing to advertise the workshop once we get the dates fixed . <@u0kv7fvnv> my advisor had a suggestion of a potential r module guest lecturer . can i promise this new person a trip to some other nordic country out of coderefinery budget to give the once ? ok i can take jupyter , doc and git collab . can i just take a moment to point out that this thread-thing is working out really well ? yes you can ! oops , i\\u2019ll fix it . i think so too and i will annoy the nay sayers with new threads until they also get into the vibe :slightly_smiling_face: . great ! sabry you are ok with git intro ? main pain point there is the staging which needs to be reworked , also no external slides allowed :slightly_smiling_face: but of course you are allowed and most welcome to change what we have right now . awesome ! yes . ume\\xe5 oct 16 planning <@u21ph491q> <@u23htrtjt> . it\\'s us three . do you prefer me to be there or do you prefer to do it without me ? you don\\'t have to be diplomatic :slightly_smiling_face: i would love to participate but also i don\\'t mind having one travel less - your call . how would you like to distribute the lecturing so that there is enough time for everybody to prepare ? since i\\u2019ll do the git-collab in aarhus i wouldn\\u2019t mind doing it in ume\\xe5 as well . (although my preference would be to do git-intro in both , but sabry called it first ! ) . it definitely makes sense to collocate to minimize work and maximize focus . as to the git-collab: don\\'t take anything for granted , change everything that makes no sense , use prs and issues in doubt , if i would change one thing then more exercises . and regarding your presence , it always nice to have you around <@u0kv7fvnv> ! sure , i\\u2019ll have a close look next week . also one thing i would like to have added to lesson is that we not only give an overview of required software but also overview of required accounts and guides on how to get rid of the accounts to avoid that we pull people into services and leave them there alone . yeah it makes sense to have a separate section for required accounts , and how do delete them . < ! channel> i was asked to make you aware of the neic culture book: <https://wiki . neic . no/wiki/neic_culture> . < ! channel> it is my duty to hold development talks with all team members - i will contact you individually but please already consult the template <https://wiki . neic . no/w/ext/img_auth . php/f/f4/development_talk_template_%281%29 . pdf> . sure , it\\'s not software . <@u21ph491q> i\\'d like to at least mention a protected master and prs to it inside the same repo in git-collab as that\\'s how teams that are inside the same organization usually do things . or at least we do at csc . +1 from me - it is good to mention both and also discuss advantages and disadvantages . ack , sorry for the delay in responding very sick these 2 days . can you please elaborate bit on \" staging which needs to be reworked\" . bj\\xf8rn: very good idea to couple ide with debugging , good use case and we are anyway a bit weak on debugging tools in the course . sabry: what i meant is that the git staging part of the git intro lesson does not work well currently , too confusing so if i needed to change one thing in the lesson , that would be it: more pictures , better example - of course no problem to change more than the staging but that is the part that i am most unhappy with . i will do that . less and clear is better than more and confusing - now it\\'s more and confusing (blaming myself here) . what we wish to achieve is that participants understand *why* staging , that\\'s the goal . ack . but please go through entire lesson and add issues on anything that you find strange or unclear or too much . ok , i would like to simplify a little and transfer a slide from my last attempt to the docs . sounds great - best way is through prs , for major changes i recommend to first open issue , discuss it , then implement it . i know . i would like us to start writing short sweet good practice guides in forms of blog posts - or blog posts about whatever; short: 1-2 screens - this would help us to get more activity going over twitter so we would solve two issues in one go (more activity and good practice guides which have longer reach than workshops) - anybody excited about some topic that you would like to blog about ? do we already have a way to subscribe to announcements about a particular workshop ? i like the idea . we do need a real blog platform for it though as the comments can be valuable . how about accepting comments via email/twitter ? yes: <https://docs . google . com/forms/d/1gjwvxfgkvszov3c998hu1zjukh0_kdcqfsp5dzio2wm/> (3 people signed up) - every time we open a registration we should look into that list . rephrasing: i have nothing against enabling comments if i get help in setting that up (too much already on my todo list) plus a little worry about spam/vandalism . good , good . it was a brilliant idea (thanks for the idea ! ) . so simple and effective (we just need to not forget) . a snic training newsletter is due tomorrow . i\\u2019ll go ahead and announce the aarhus workshop , right ? i had a meeting with anders from deic about gitlab and we both left the meeting feeling good and confident . on a technical level this should be a piece of cake . excellent ! i am very happy that you met and discussed . a bit unfortunate that our workshops weren\\u2019t included in the latest neic training newsletter email , which came out today . i\\u2019ll ask joel to put the workshops on the calendar at least . indeed pity - i guess it is our duty to place it on the calendar but it is simply too much for me to keep track of so i cannot do it . on the upside: registrations rolling in so i am not terribly worried about the workshop . good to hear ! i don\\u2019t remember how we got included on the calendar with previous workshops , can\\u2019t find any email about it . it somehow worked :slightly_smiling_face: for sure i never did anything to get them into the calendar . <@u23htrtjt> wow , so far your blog entry <https://csc . fi/de/web/blog/post/-/blogs/coderefinery-and-the-red-queen-s-race> has slipped my attention . oh , what i missed , you have really marvelous writing skills , i\\'m all caught in awe , very impressive , indeed . :-) . really let me compliment you on that skills , that is really an asset , i\\'m sure if you no longer want to write code , you could easily switch to something else . i\\'ll start writing books about writing code . ok i added our october events to the neic-training calendar . apparently it was i who did it last time (i actually remember now) . we should add this item to our workshop planning todo list . :slightly_smiling_face: great ! where do we have our workshop planning todo list now ? i think once converged this would make a great blog since others could learn from us . in other words i think it should be on our website if it is not yet . there used to be a template document under workshops , now i only found filled forms under specific workshops . i recreated the template workshops/workshop_planning_template . and added about the neic calendar dissemination . thanks ! +1 from me - really beautiful post . a little motivational friday email (user is very happy with the gitlab service; we will talk about the docker registry part): . hi radovan , i have a question about the <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> gitlab service (which i\\'m very happy with by the way): recent versions of gitlab integrates a gitlab container registry for hosting docker containers . <https://about . gitlab . com/2016/05/23/gitlab-container-registry/> is it conceivable that you could host such a docker registry as part of the coderefinary service ? i just wanted to check if it is within the scope of what you\\'re trying to achieve or if we definitely need to find somewhere else . cheers , -thomas- . aarhus: 11 registrations in; edit: 13 registrations . i would like to modularize better the installation instructions: how about we move them closer to lessons and reference them from the schedule ? participants will have to do more clicking but we will get lessons which will become pluggable . good idea ? bad idea ? idea for those who enjoy working with jekyll/css: it would be great if we would mark more explicitly in our material what is to be typed by participants , what they should expect as output and where they can lean back - it is otherwise not always clear to participants where their action is required . i would like to make that clearer with colors . this is doable . we\\'ve got this in our own internal gitlab installation that uses the same code as the coderefinery one . would just need to be deployed . it would add additional steps to the migration though . i think this would add a lot of value - but before we do this i need to check whether deic can maintain that; it would be pity if we set it up and turn it off two weeks later . how did the nordunet workshop go ? it went fine . got some interesting new information about e . g . federations . it would have been nice if there would have been more platform people around , but since it was mainly for nrens it wasn\\'t surprising that there weren\\'t that many of them . thanks for the summary . i think it\\u2019ll be better . if we\\u2019re going to do more events like the one in ume\\xe5 , with only one topic , it\\u2019s better than having to write \\u201conly follow the instructions for git\\u2026\\u201d . and also since we vary the material from workshop to workshop . we kind of touched this with anders and i don\\'t recall a strong yes or a strong no . the space requirement might be quite a bit more than for the gl proper , but disk space isn\\'t *that* expensive and i suppose we could implement some kind of \"face control\" . coderefinery slot was the very last in the whole conference so audience wasn\\'t super energetic . but i did get multiple positive comments , jan would like to help with the trondheim workshop and we could consider working with common conservancy to create a guide for setting up open source projects . <@u2k0egsc8> could you do me a favor and announce the ume\\xe5 1-day workshop on twitter ? tweeted . thanks . great ! thanks a lot for delivering the talk ! and that\\'s great news . ok let\\'s do it . <@u2k0egsc8> (and others) - let me know if you want twitter credentials for the coderefine account to post news directly to the world . so , back to this again . i\\'ve been thinking about this is and i thought that before we make the first commit there should be a small example with post-its and a whiteboard explaining the concepts of commit , previous commit , branch and a merge . <@u21ph491q> did you book a hotel already ? i\\'m making a travel plan and i plan to arrive on sunday and leave on monday around 7pm . i haven\\u2019t . i can ask our local guy in ume\\xe5 if they have recommendations . good morning . good morning . i ran a hm this saturday . time was 1:49 but afterwards we discovered that the track was 360m longer than it should have been . it was still a personal best by over a minute so i\\'m happy . did we have a meeting today ? i\\'m teaching so can\\'t attend if we did . well done ! was it a city race ? i feel very tempted now to run a particular 10km race in october , doesn\\u2019t hurt that it\\u2019s the \\u201cfastest 10k race in sweden\\u201d since you end up a few hundred meters below where you start . no meeting today , next one is sept 25 . <@u23htrtjt> <@u0kv7fvnv> , pedro recommended bj\\xf6rken hotel since it\\u2019s 5 minutes away from the campus . <https://sv . hotels . com/ho446189/hotell-bjorken-umea-sverige/ ?

or do you have height differences south of lappland ? it was espoo , so mostly pedestrian footpaths and sand . thanks ! excellent ! you guys are much better than my hm history - i need to up my game . no the fastest 10k run in sweden is actually in a stockholm suburb: <http://www . hasselbyloppet . se/start/> . apparently the height difference is only 11 meters though , i thought one started up some hill . everybody except erik: please come back to me with a time suggestion for a development talk - i am required to hold it and i believe it will be to your benefit . hopefully you have something in your email inbox last week . done . oh right that . aand done . aarhus workshop registration survey . <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/utm0nu/q4v424klb8scizry> . conclusions for me: we keep cmake and we need to adapt testing lesson to fortran and c(++) . also we need something on modular code development . everybody please have a look at <https://trello . com/b/4jyowv7h/coderefinery-status> and update so that i know what is in progress and what is not (it is important that the board reflects reality so only put a card on progress if you really work on it; if you don\\'t have time to work on stuff then i want the board to reflect it so let\\'s not have stuff on in progress just for the board to look good) . this is not to control you but to minimize confusion (two people working on the same task or a task not being done because person 1 thinks that person 2 is working on it) . ack . done . please everybody send a mock support request email to <mailto:support@coderefinery . zendesk . com|support@coderefinery . zendesk . com> , observe the receipt notification and also my response to you , check whether they land in your spam folder (they unfortunately do for me which sucks) . when are we planning to open the sign up for espoo workshop in december ? i ask because our marketing team would like to mention the workshop in a newsletter that goes out next week . i\\'ll ask if the \"sign up to be notified\" page will suffice . no problem to set up a page and open until then - i would like to do one thing before announcing and that is to contact richard darst (who was keen on contributing) whether he would like to join in with a session - i will write to him and check . i have written to richard - but we can set up the workshop page next week and announce . please remind me in case i forget . i don\\'t see why we can\\'t just advertise joining on the notification list . also i finally remembered to email markus kainu about the r module yesterday . great - good idea to advertise the notification list . this gives us more air . csc has a whole bureaucratic process for this and a couple of bureaucrats who manage that process as part of their duties . i fear they may be disappointed by our being a bit more agile , but will argument that we are permitted to do things our own way in the name of nordic supercooperation . worked great with csc email but i\\'ll try with gmail as well . i can also try to interpret the mail headers . i keep marking as \"not spam\" so hopefully the machine will learn and let them through , will also try <https://www . groovehq . com> but is more expensive . can you click \"show original\" and send me the output from there ? there\\'s a \"download original\" button at least in gmail . best send as an attachment to an email . sent as email attachment . <@u2k0egsc8> <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u21ph491q> the aarhus workshops is basically full (great ! ) - please study <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/utm0nu/q4v424klb8scizry> carefully . ack . good to hear ! i really like that we added the \\u201cwhich sessions are you interested in\\u201d question . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u23htrtjt> we have 12 registrations now to the ume\\xe5 workshop . typeform result here: <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/bsa4we/hegcisumsez9srm4> . yes , that is really good to know - before we were just assuming , now we have more support for that . awesome ! nice , looks like an appreciative audience . neic board meeting with mid-term review behind us - official minutes , statements , and recommendation yet to be prepared and confirmed but it seems we have good support to plan for a follow-up project - great work everybody ! thanks for testing the zendesk support line - i managed to hide it behind <mailto:support@coderefinery . org|support@coderefinery . org> - this will give us the possibility to change support solutions in future without people noticing . out of luck also the spam folder issue seems solved . yup , it was due to zendesk really , really not wanting people to fake emails coming from zendesk . we have no such high-level mail configs in place on <http://coderefinery . org|coderefinery . org> . <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u21ph491q> <@u23htrtjt> i have added you as agents to <https://coderefinery . zendesk . com> - the support email is now <mailto:support@coderefinery . org|support@coderefinery . org> . please protest if you wish to not be an agent . i am not sure whether zendesk has emailed you about it . if not , you might need to register but hopefully you can now administrate tickets together with me . i received mail , registered . yes i would like to involve in this . my goal is that all gitlab and workshop related questions go to that support line , i will update the website to reflect that . looking trough you tube for good tutorials . i am now paying the cheapo plan on a monthly basis - if we realize that we don\\'t like it we will reconsider . ack . how does this work ? i sign op or i got an email about it ? (i haven\\'t read my email) . i am not sure how it looks on your side - sabry ? i received a mail , copied the link and opened it (not a fan of clicking things) . first time login it gave me an option to create password . same for me . i registered and can now see the dashboard . let me bring up the \\u201c6-ish\\u201d month post-workshop survey again . i\\u2019m prepared to make some final adjustments and send it out to participants in the espoo and sthlm workshops . any comments ? can you post a link to the survey ? then we can have a final read through . and thanks for remembering . the questions are here: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1p38fjtrrjasscwhe29afue2ygmnwlelfcuw1eaflwse/edit> . i haven\\u2019t made a typeform yet . and the email is here: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/11qflu_cxxhomazx1qrih3ssgk_ezplayxsi_zwvfukw/edit> . the questions are i think very good but i would like to have a look at the typeform just to check whether we can optimize the flow or layout . email is great . we could possibly also include the copenhagen workshop . also we need to mark in the contacts spreadsheet who received this email and we should not send it out to people who did not show up - let me know if the latter is not easy to see . yes , i\\u2019ll look into the email logistics . i\\u2019ll also do the typeform now and send the link . thanks for doing this ! and feel free to edit of course the email spreadsheet and improve things . here\\u2019s the typeform: <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/to/x3yzth> . i have one issue , which is whether we should ask separately about version control and git in question 3 , and also whether sphinx should be there at all (now both readthedocs and github-pages are included) . it says \"start registration\" at the beginning . i would remove git and keep version control . i agree . and skip sphinx ? indeed probably good to remove sphinx . change github pages to github/gitlab/bitbucket pages . i changed to \\u201cstart survey\\u201d . does typeform offer the possiblity to present question 3 as a table so that it feels less repetitive ? no this is the only method i could see , but let me have one more look . same for question 4 . regarding the spreadsheet , what do red colors mean in the day 1/2/3 attendance column ? normal attendance is green , blank means not present , but red ? red are people who definitely did not show up and did not inform me - blank are people where i wasn\\'t sure anymore (often i kept notes on the right) . i think we should only email people who have received a certificate . also i would change \"start survey\" to \"start 4 minute survey\" (feel free to adapt 4; i would like to indicate somewhere , can be in the text that this is a short survey) . ok , only to the certified people . yes i\\u2019ll add \\u201c5 minute\\u201d . so , what they call \\u201cmatrix questions\\u201d are possible only for \\u201crating\\u201d and \\u201copinion scale\\u201d . i went for \\u201cmultiple choice\\u201d to be able to customize the categories (\\u201cstarted using this tool\\u201d etc) . we may miss 2-3 people but the certified have def attended . one could use opinion scale , and explain in the description that 1 means \\u201cdon\\u2019t use this tool\\u201d , 2 means \\u201cstarted using\\u201d , etc . but on the other hand that might be confusing . if it\\'s impossible to arrange in table , then i think the current survey is good to go . agree , table lookup numbers-meaning is confusing and tiring . ok , so green light to send ? oh important question , should we send automatic reply ? or is that just annoying . i\\u2019m thinking annoying . ok , typeform sent to espoo , stockholm and cph participants who received certificate . i got 3 out-of-office replies , one of this included this interesting line: \\u201ci\\u2019m out of the office and will be back at 125th of september\\u201d . haha :slightly_smiling_face: nice - thanks for sending it out ! yup , apparently got an email . <@u0kv7fvnv> i\\'m a bit worried that i may not have time to serve customers before december at the earliest . jyry , that is completely fine - then don\\'t worry about signing up - we will give this \"seat\" to somebody else . 6 replies already and they look positive and useful . surprise ! nice . idea for modular code development session: we split people according to favorite language , groups discuss for 20 minutes strategies for modular development and write down best practices , finally we synthesize findings and discuss them - this would work around the one big problem that this is very language specific . hmm , interesting . i think it\\u2019s definitely worth trying . team meeting monday sep 25 cancelled (i will be on a plane) - meeting moves to oct 2; please review and update trello board , thank you ! rest we do via slack . ok . good morning anyways ! i came back from a short and rainy trip to iceland yesterday , and celebrated my dads 60th birthday last night . ack . good morning . best wishes for your farther . morning everybody (stopover in oslo) - yesterday wonderful day in tromso - blue skies , t-shirt weather , yellow trees , almost one hour flying time on new wing . so climate change is a good thing . it was indeed a spectacular late sept day for local standards; better than many june or july days . 13 people have answered our post-workshop survey ! see results here:<https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/x3yzth/ooag7fmrsw8ztew4> . this doesn\\u2019t include the answers to \\u201cwhat changes would you suggest\\u201d and \\u201cwhat else has changed\\u201d , maybe i\\u2019ll copy those to a document on drive . regarding sending postcards , we need postcards with the coderefinery logo ! pretty encouraging ! hope we get some more in , we should re-spam soon . also for me the take-home is that the testing and code coverage part needs to be improved . yeah ! (postcards) . from a local support case: . btw2 we have installed jupyterhub on our indecol server and people like it here ! i am just giving them short introduction to jupyter using the the coderefinery github example ! best radek . bravo ! the freeform answers are in the spreadsheet post-workshop-survey-results , in the workshops folder . btw , another lesson learned is that the \\u201cgithub/gitlab/bitbucket pages\\u201d question may have been misunderstood by many who didn\\u2019t notice \\u201cpages\\u201d and thought we meant just the repo hosting . it\\'s a real rad example on all the bells and whistles of what you can do with notebooks . great for people who already know how to code but don\\'t know notebooks . got let\\'s encrypt certificate expiration notice for domain \"<http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org>\" (oct 16) - is this under controll (renewal scripted) ? might be the last renewal before moving to deic . alas it isn\\'t . thanks for looking into it (but we do have time) - and let me know if there is something i can do . can you remind me next week ? ok will do . i\\'m so swamped this week it makes dagobah look like a vacation resort . :slightly_smiling_face: good luck . is the aarhus workshop fully booked ? i see 26 regs to i\\u2019m guessing it is . just wondering whether i should advertise it again on snic-training list . i understand the comfortable limit for the room is 30 - we will get few more registrations and we will get few no-shows so i believe we don\\'t need aggressive advertising since we are basically full - thanks though . 35 can fit but apparently it is then packed . ok . i am now at deic conference and also did some advertising here - so it will be fine . excellent . check for fire regulation rules and ventilation capacity . pure number of seats can be misleading . hmm , something happened which i don\\u2019t understand . the jekyll layout for <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-collaborative/> seems to have vanished , which also means that the episodes aren\\u2019t included . i made a couple of commits to the git-collab repo but can\\u2019t see how that could have anything to do with it . any ideas ? radovan refactored all the repos at one point to have the jekyll layouts etc . in a separate repo so it can be the same for all . could be an artefact of that . hmm , the jekyll-common submodule is still there in the git-collab repo tho . oh no everything is gone !!! just kidding :slightly_smiling_face: i have a feeling for what it is; something change on the github side , i had the same with the mma lesson and fixed it already in the jekyll-common - cd jekyll-common; git checkout master; git pull; cd .. ; git add jekyll-common; git commit; git push; relief :slightly_smiling_face: . my info is that 25 participants plus instructors is comfortable - difficult to check beyond that remotely but i trust my local agent there . you guys (and still girls ? ) have backups right ? of what ? a question about workshops: would you consider running one in lund ? we will consider it but it is a question of time - i am personally completely maxed out until end of the year . one option is to run it in 2018 . need to check with others . budget-wise probably no problem . <https://twitter . com/tdhopper/status/913447685541285888> . brilliant :slightly_smiling_face: . so in short: tentatively yes but to be confirmed . i will really insist that in this channel we use threads and everybody has to use either a slack client or the slack web client , see top of this page - sorry <@u0a9nv7px> :slightly_smiling_face: there is imo huge value in threading; a number of people outside of this channel see it differently but in this channel i will insist on it - i do not wish messages and questions to be lost only because some unofficial clients do not support threading - thank you ! it is also ok for me to move away from slack to something else but it is not ok for me to agree on slack within neic but then not agree on slack - this is inconsistent . supported ! (does this go into a thread ? ) . nope it didn\\'t :slightly_smiling_face: . you need to use this little speech bubble to comment within a thread - they are weird at the beginning but it is actually well done . ach so ! approved ! :slightly_smiling_face: . i support it . it happens that i forget though\\u2026 . it is allowed to forget :slightly_smiling_face: i just wanted to oppose a general rejection of a useful feature . i cannot force people outside of our channel but i thought that here we can agree on something . ok , i\\'ll try to confirm . :wink: . awesome ! i think you will like it ! thank you . totally overloaded interface , so not sure . i did not like the interface at first but learned to like it after some time . slack needs a textbased client imo . but lynx was also the best browser of all times . again , i have nothing against slack alternatives but only don\\'t want to compromise features - unthreaded chatting is basically impossible to follow for a person who is involved with 10% or 20% in neic; also i get frequently frustrated that an important discussion dies just because some other discussion moves it outside the screen - see countless examples . looking at this again now , but still not getting it . the git-collab lesson builds fine on my laptop , but doesn\\u2019t on github . i did update jekyll-commons under git-collab . the jekyll-commons submodule is at different commits in git-intro and git-collab (newer in collab) , but mma is at the same jekyll-comons commit as git-collab , yet builds fine . any ideas ? ah now i remember - i think you need to do this: <https://github . com/coderefinery/mma/commit/2c0d6cbee7254b71e10a4da3a8745ad143543464> . and as to lynx: i think there is a reason why nobody is using it today - the world has moved on , for the better or for worse . yes that did the trick . thanks ! we have 13 responses on the follow-up survey; should we spam once again ? and if yes , let us optimize the weekday and daytime for optimum spamming success :slightly_smiling_face: i am not sure though which it would be . are there slack clients that don\\'t support threads ? some kind of irc gateways ? yes :slightly_smiling_face: . i was just thinking about it . yes i think so . one reminder is fine , after that it starts becoming annoying . interesting question about what time is optimal for announcing surveys . maybe friday afternoon , people are tired after the week and prefer lightweight tasks . so sending it now is an option . i agree , only one more . our 5-minute estimate of the time to completion of the survey isn\\u2019t bad . the average time for 16 responses is 7:04 :slightly_smiling_face: . flowdock recently added a feature for re-threading messages after writing them . i expect it to come to slack eventually . interesting ! thanks for sending it out . no hurry , but you\\'re much welcomed any time ! this one is a rather awkward example of using threads: by reading the head message there\\'s no way to figure what is it about :disappointed: . turns out it\\'s about lynx :wink: . hence the first question or information must be descriptive - of course if a discussion side tracks , then now way of seeing but it\\'s the same for emails - tech won\\'t help us here either way . got few more responses , now at 20 - good job; that is almost 30% response rate which is more than most surveys . started the weekend with attending a brass classic band concert in the nidaros dome . the cathedral\\u2019s organ was also used . impressive , <http://www . kamfest . no/en-gb/program/concert/nattkonsert+i+domen . html> . oh wow - i love organ music; wonderful weather here last weekend so spent some time outside on the mountains but also some time in front of the screen . and now one more ! yeah it\\u2019s a good response rate . cool cathedral ! i had a nice walk in the forest yesterday , it was a perfect autumn day . and then i played some chess with a friend . we should do a workshop at night accompanied with organ music . good morning . reminder: meeting today 12 cest , 13 eest: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1b-xs-srh6jw-gkv9hb1002jta-zghmvfyyonv1moutu/> . good morning ! should be doable . good morning , sabry ! <@u0kv7fvnv> can i have the twitter credentials to announce the link\\xf6ping workshop ? regarding the notify-me list . how do we use it , shall i send an announcement to everyone listed about the link\\xf6ping workshop , or only to those based in sweden ? i am staying here wakeup \\xe5rhus , <https://www . hotelwakeupcopenhagen . com/om-wakeup-copenhagen/nyheter/lavprishotellet-wakeup-aapnet-i-aarhus/#/search> . did not get it for kr 400 , - , though . looks alright . compact rooms ! i\\u2019ll see if i can book it . people provide their cities so only to those people who are close to the workshop in question . sure - will send in a direct message . few questions about the umea workshop oct 16 <@u23htrtjt> <@u21ph491q> . just to refresh my memory and avoid confusion . jyry does the intro , thor collab , and me the rest (branch design and archaeology) ? once confirmed we should add some names next to the sessions to avoid doubts . sounds good to me . i might want to contribute to the design of the branch design (no pun intended) . and i suppose we have an understanding of what roughly to mention about a shared repo , protected master -model and if needed i can help with that . <@u0kv7fvnv> yes i take git-collab . i added a few points about protected master in episode 2 of git-collab: <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-collaborative/02-distributed/> . i placed it such that it\\u2019s presented as an alternative to the forking workflow . which it effectively is for people inside the same organization . agreed , that\\u2019s best . only downside is possible branch clutter . jyry you take intro or me ? i\\'d like to . i have some thoughts about lightly introducing all the concepts before starting with the hands-on part . ok good - i will update the page , please rework the staging part , either brutally simplify or skip , feel free to of course change other things - in doubt issues/prs as always . also it would probably be good if we distribute actual times so that we are not surprised and don\\'t run overtime; how much time will both of you use/need ? i\\'ll have to meditate on that at least until tomorrow . that\\'s fine to take time - but please remind me then , my head is about to explode from keeping all this stuff in my head :slightly_smiling_face: . i\\u2019m thinking 1 . 5h , if that\\u2019s available to me . did we ask about previous git knowledge in the sign-up form ? to me it looks like we have 6 h in total so 1 . 5-2 h for collab is no problem and well spent . <@u23htrtjt> not exactly , we asked if people used git and github . 64% do use git and 50% a web-based repo . see <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/bsa4we/hegcisumsez9srm4> . boo , 2 windows users . and after recently giving an infovis course i find the fact that answers are sorted based on number of respondents and not an ordinal scale deplorable . how about 2h intro , 2h collab , 1 . 5h me with some buffer for q&amp;a ? sounds good . there\\'s a break in the 2h i assume ? i don\\'t know how the breaks are distributed but assume that we start at 9 , break at 10:30-ish , lunch 12 , break 15-ish , end 17 . but yeah , breaks - not powering through for 2 hrs . the time scheduling sounds good . and yes , breaks are important . i\\u2019ve been thinking that we should have a nice design for posters , a4 or a3 , to advertise workshops on campuses . problem is it should look nice and professional . does anyone have such skills ? that is an excellent idea . could we just go the way of mikkeller beer labels ? or xkcd comics ? i . e . \"we teach code , we don\\'t draw fancy posters\" . i also like if it looked simple and different than the \"boring\" posters . haha . like ! would this be a case for a derivative work under cc-attribution noncommercial for this ? <https://xkcd . com/208/> . with perl replaced by coderefinery . i love both ideas (simple message and/or comic if possible) . advantage of comics is that people look at them . hmm , interesting ideas . or use memes , kids nowadays love those right ? \\u201ci dont always write code , but when i do it\\u2019s version controlled\\u201d . \\u201cone does not simply write code without version control\\u201d . haha . \"friends don\\'t let friends write untested code\" . good ideas - we should also have those on twitter and website . hm , that was meant to go into thread , sorry . haha no that\\'s great - we need more such memes . heads up: one thing we will have to do imo very soon is to modularize the install instructions (move them closer to lessons) - i can do a first go and create a framework for it unless somebody else prefers to; needs to be done by the end of the week to give ume\\xe5 participants the chance to install stuff without installing a lot of unnecessary dependencies . i had it in mind as the next thing to do , but it would be great if you set up the framework . i can then migrate stuff . i don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s absolutely critical to finish it before ume\\xe5 since i\\u2019ve pointed out to the registered participants that only the git and python parts need consideration . ok , that\\'s good to know - i will do first steps and let\\'s see . coderefinery should have (at least) one workshop at the ahm2018 meeting . shall we discuss which one to give ? radovan has suggested git , but i could do jupyter as well . i\\'d actually vote on a \"jupyter , it does all these things\" with a strong \"imagine the possibilities\" -theme . grumpy cat: \\u201cwell documented code ? no such thing\\u201d . i think we can omit the non-cool parts with this audience . yeah plenty of cool things we don\\u2019t have now . maybe we could even demo some big-data type of analysis (e . g . with holoviews , which i recently learned about) . or i dunno , some kind of submitting a job to the back-end for computation . or if we have it finished by then , running deep learning on <http://notebooks . csc . fi|notebooks . csc . fi> with gpu-backed notebooks . but i think inviting people to imagine the medium-term future is something that would work well at ahm . another alternative would be a group exercise where groups plan how they might use a system like notebooks in teaching or something similar . it is of course fine for me to not give the git one - i was also thinking of not giving our usual git course but developing a new one , targeting in particular non-technical people who are thrown into git and github when entering neic and needs some unconfusion - but it is work to prepare it which i am happy to skip :slightly_smiling_face: jupyter is always good . \"i don\\'t always write code , but when i do i do it in production\" . <@u21ph491q> i think the boromir quote might be better suited to writing untested code . yes , that\\u2019s indeed better: \\u201cone does not simply write untested code\\u201d . <https://www . hypable . com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lotr-frodo-baggins-quotes-i-will-take-the-ring . jpg> . a beautiful allegory of research libraries . hmm , as fun as this sounds , i\\u2019m not sure if advertising a workshop this way gives the right impression . if i would walk past a poster with a meme on it i might look at it , chuckle , and move on . that\\'s a good question . a single xkcd-like comic might still work . and i suppose any poster is better than none unless you offend someone . sorry for being ignorant , what is ahm2018 ? all hands meeting in skeikampen , norway . see <http://ahm17 . neic . nordforsk . org/> . thanx . i just realized that i might not have informed you about it (in case you are not following <#c050v61rb|general>) . <https://neicnordic . github . io/ahm18 . neic . nordforsk . org/> . ok , thank you . i joined the \"general\" . oh - i thought it was technically impossible to not be in general . <https://jvns . ca/teach-tech-with-cartoons/> . <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u21ph491q> <@u2k0egsc8> please double check schedule here: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-10-24-aarhus/> - please let me know if you are not comfortable with some assignment there . looks good to me . nice that we have a helper ! dan is also the person who arranged the room , and he offered to help - very nice . i booked the same ! i\\u2019ve been in touch with a company in stockholm to print postcards and stickers . we now have to decide what to print , format and number ! there\\u2019s a document stickers . pdf in the logo folder on our drive . i like pages 1 and 4 for stickers , and pages 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 for postcards . what\\u2019s your take ? i like page 4 sticker best and we definitely can use stickers - i am personally not sure yet about the postcards but perhaps we could order a small sample stack of those too . i am comfortable - teeth chattering , but comfortable\\u2026 . we never end up with unused time so if something is not doable or too rushed (ide ? ) we can take it out of the program as well - but i rather recommend to reduce that part to 30-45 minutes of mostly demo and discussion . stickers: 1 , 2 , 4 (prefered order) . agree with <@u21ph491q> on the postcards . we can also print 1 and 4 stickers , then everybody is happy . sounds good , let\\u2019s go for page 1 and 4 for the stickers . how many ? i got a rough quote , 400 stickers for 1500-2000 sek . sounds reasonable - for me this is the price reference: <https://www . stickermule . com/products/die-cut-stickers> - so the quote is not outrageous . please check whether the stickers are square or cut . we can choose how we want them . what will look best is if they\\u2019re perforated along the dashed lines (seen in stickers 1 and 4) , so that they\\u2019re not square when you peel them off . that will cost a little more though . shall we go for that ? also , i was thinking to use the opportunity to print my business cards as well . is that ok ? budget-wise i mean . definitely ok for the business cards (i would use the opportunity to print mine too) - cut looks much better - if it is a lot more expensive than stickermule , i can order from stickermule . ok i\\u2019ll ask for a quote . shall we choose the size such that the actual sticker (inside the perforated area) is around 3x3inches ? and regarding business cards , i don\\u2019t see yours in the drive folder , only mine . can you upload it ? as to stickers: the smaller the better , so it fits on computer laptops next to many other stickers but should not be miniature either . business cards: uploaded to logo/artwork . i booked it as well . will be flying out again on the thursday evening . i am flying out friday morning - not possible to reach on the same day . we need ideas for cross-team session at neic all-hands meeting 2018 . got this via email: . hi , aren\\'t you interested in learning about other neic projects ? did you successfully meet a technological or methodological challenge in your project that you would like to share with other neic projects ? wouldn\\'t you be interested in discussing some of these challenges and associated solutions with other neic colleagues ? then you\\'ll probably like our cross-team session at ahm 2018 ! but we are not here yet ... and to be successful we need to define teams before the neic all hands meeting . so we would like each project to submit at least one proposal for a short hands-on/show me your tool session . these should be hands on sessions , with a practical approach aiming to share skills and technologies useful for other projects . please prepare a short proposal for the second f2f pm-po meeting in espoo (12th october 2017) , including the subject with a brief statement explaining the particular problem/challenge you successfully faced . do not hesistate to contact <#c5yk6376g|ahm-planning> on neic slack channel or to reply to this email if you have any questions . more information on the crossteam sessions can be found at <https://neicnordic . github . io/ahm18 . neic . nordforsk . org/crossteam/> on behalf of the ahm organization team , anne . please suggest how we can contribute there . my idea: \"how to optimize the use of slack for a busy team contributing to many projects with many tools\" - i could demonstrate with a simple hands-on exercise that the \"simply type without any indentation\" very rapidly fails . other ideas very welcome . and you can use the opportunity to preach about slack threads ! :wink: . i think we should just show rather informally what tools we use and how we use them . i think the idea is for 1-2 members of each project to present their tools , while the other project members can attend other projects\\u2019 presentations . i would like people to simply realize through an exercise that not using threads does not work without really preaching it . but i am super happy if somebody else than me presents some tools in less evangelizing way than me . in short: i got the task to come up with something before oct 12 . maybe \"an example day in the coderefinery project\" with things we do with a story behind them and presenting the tools . also , this would probably be mildly interesting to hear from other projects as well . cool ! please prepare a one-paragraph proposal that i can communicate back . \"an example workday in coderefinery . in this presentation we will present typical tools and workflows around a simple fictional story narrative . the aim is to give other participants a glimpse into how we do things so they can tell what they do better and reflect on what we (possibly) do better in a geographically distributed team . \" . to expand we could use role play where people play the parts of team members and then say out loud what they\\'re doing while their displays are shown on the big screen . and if we could induce other teams to do the same we could have *shudder* cross-pollination of ideas . thank you ! nothing wrong with cross-pollination of ideas mind you . it just sounds like a buzzword to me . :slightly_smiling_face: yes buzzword bingo word . if this materializes , would you be happy leading such a session with me probably in the room to assist ? as mentioned earlier i have other plans for that week . ah ok sorry that i forgot . that\\'s why i\\'m so free with ideas as i won\\'t be the one to implement them :wink: . is there somebody who would like to implement such a session ? (i am interested myself but too much stuff is depending on me , i need to delegate this) . if it is me , it will be a demo of optimizing present toolset in neic based on my experiences - super biased but i can do that with 10 minute preparation . :+1: for the delegation of tasks . i want to participate in this dicussion but i\\u2019m tied up today\\u2026 i\\u2019ll catch up tomorrow . i think there\\'s plenty of time before january . its just that we need to send in a proposal before 12th next week . no problem to postpone discussion by few days - thanks for participating , all ideas welcome . csc colleagues: just remembered that i will be at csc for a meeting oct 12 and for the d-wave course oct 31 - nov 1; in case you would like to chat , then let us meet for coffee or beer . <@u2k0z6mdg> great that you\\'re working on the staging part . can we discuss your vision once you have a draft ? of course , i will working in an own branch . good morning . <@u0kv7fvnv>: coderefinery google drive folder now successfully linked from within neic xt folder (hopefully easier to find coderefinery information from neic xt and manage xt access rights to it in only one place) . awesome ! thanks . good morning ! we got fresh snow powder sugar above 1000 m yesterday - my weekend was cinema , programming , and also flying - first time experienced being lifted upwards and actually had to do some work to get down on ground . thumbs up for less siloed information and better redundancy . what does this mean ? . good morning team . i had a calm weekend . saw blade runner last night , it was awesome ! it means that our documents are easier to access for people in neic management , for us it makes no direct difference , for me it makes hopefully the difference that the neic management will rather look at the documents instead of asking me for some information :slightly_smiling_face: . thanx . really looking forward to seeing that movie - will try this week . meeting today usual time , please update trello board and please complete agenda: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1_-wozzh6_ka1b907hkiyucgfnz-mdbvzcejr6to2lcq/> . if you want comments feel free to push to gh and give me a heads up . a friend i went with found it too long , but i wouldn\\u2019t have wanted it any shorter . the visual design and sound are just spectacularly well done . i only heard very good things about the movie - also loved the original book so it is a must see for me . ack . who is maintaining /where the waiting list for course participation requests ? . it\\u2019s in the registrations document under workshops , on drive . sorry for late reply: ideally us now :slightly_smiling_face: i am happy that the administration is decentralizing a bit , thanks for help . also let us keep the late registration tickets open until we either can give them a seat or have to decline , then we won\\'t forget to notify them . good idea , yes . if you have ideas , i am all ears :slightly_smiling_face: . i think the crossteam session is a good opportunity to show git , and use the workshop format for jupyter . it\\u2019s supposed to be in hands-on format , so we can live-demonstrate and exercise a pull request workflow . for example on one of our lessons . and since we\\u2019re urged to propose more than one option , maybe something about our hosting service ? how the project has solved some practical issue regarding running the gitlab ? i\\u2019ve created a folder neic-ahm2018-jan in the workshops folder where we can start drafting the proposals . aha yes - in fact i did not understand the session goals until now when i finally read the documentation :slightly_smiling_face: yes , git is good and so are jupyter notebooks . but jupyter will be in the workshops section . yes . as to the gitlab: i am as of now not sure that the people running the service will be at ahm , i personally still think we use slack better than other teams and other teams can learn from us , git is great , we could also demo typeform and how we use it . it is unlikely the people running it will be at the ahm once we hand it over to deic . good points , yes let\\u2019s show how we use slack and also typeform and maybe even zendesk . and also git . so have two separate proposals , one for git , the other for slack/typeform/zendesk , right ? yes - that sounds good . will these all be parallel sessions ? each 1 . 5 h long ? hmm , this is a bit unclear . the crossteam session should have 3 parts: a flash talk to introduce a project , then hands-on session , and finally speed blogging . it seems to me that the schedule on the website hasn\\u2019t been carefully designed to relate logically to these three parts . i\\u2019ll bring it up with the ahm planning team . i\\u2019ve asked for clarification from the crossteam organizers . thanks - i just got a bit worried that if each project suggests two topics we end up with 12+ sessions , 6 people in each , and then there might not be much cross-team left . ok i spoke with them and clarified the format . we agreed on asking 3 things from each neic project: 1) a 5 minute flash talk , 2) a topic for a hands-on session , focusing on how each team handles a particular practical everyday problem , 3) a future-looking question , e . g . \\u201chow can we establishe a nordic infrastructure for x\\u201d , or \\u201chow can we establish a nordic community of rses\\u201d . the hands-on and the future-looking question discussion will each have ~1 . 5h . thanks and right now we should then send in a proposal for one hands-on session right ? and at this stage no proposal for future-looking question ? what i am unsure about: what does the ahm committee require from me for oct 12 . i will ask in <#c5yk6376g|ahm-planning> . ok back to here: thor , thanks for preparing the proposals in the drive; who can actually present this (meaning who is present and is not tied up in something else) ? ack . <@u23htrtjt> a reminder about the letsencrypt for <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> (will expire oct 16; sorry that this is still on your table , i am really working on the migration) . <@u23htrtjt> i would like to re-split <https://github . com/coderefinery/ides-testing> and apply changes to ide and testing separately and later retire the combined one . is this something you would like to do or should i do it ? <@u2b3dh142> this is good stuff here <https://github . com/coderefinery/automation/pull/7> but should we rather make it a separate repo ? if yes , are you able to do it or do you need help with setting that up ? motivation for splitting: more modularity and separation of concerns (although it is of course nice to show testing on ides) . i purposely made a new repo and left the old ones untouched . if you want i can move over any changes worth saving . don\\'t worry . should already have done something about it . i mean we don\\'t really have to remove your repo but i will soon work on the isolated ones and did not want your changes to get lost . also if you guys can squeeze in an upgrade that would be great but no stress , no over time , and coderefinery will pay for this time . aarhhus workshop location seems to be 3h from cph airport . any one know how the transport from airport ? may be i should come the day befoore . denmark i small . you can go by train to aarhus . i take a flight from kastrup . ok . i will look into setting up a separate repo . i will consult you if i have any problems . sorry for the silence , we\\'ve had an ae meeting at pdc . i can prepare proposals and communicate them with the ahm-planning people in charge of the crossteam sessions . but do give your input on the documents if you have any . i think arriving same day is very tight , especially since you will be the first on stage so i would (and will) arrive the day before . i will go through them tonight and edit the files , thanks for your work on this ! <@u2k0z6mdg> so what is your timeframe on this ? because i\\'ll be giving the intro next monday . i haven\\u2019t done much really , but i\\u2019ll send in a proposal tomorrow . i heard from them yesterday that no-one had sent in any proposals yet , which is understandable since the task was poorly defined . thanks for your input btw ! feel free to remove the slack hands-on , that was just an idea - thanks for your work on this . <https://keybase . io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone> . this is really huge . cool ! i\\u2019ve received an offer for printing stickers , postcards and business cards . it\\u2019s 2200 sek for 2x50 stickers (the main cost is having it performated , since they need to create a stamp thing for it) , 1600 sek for 4x20 postcards , and 1700 sek for 200 business cards . opening a new thread for the ahm2018 . since workshops is what we do in coderefinery , i think it\\u2019s not unreasonable for us to contribute two workshops , one jupyter and one git . in the crossteam sessions we can have slack and typeform . opinions ? thanks a lot ! hmm hmm hmm ... the stickermule one looks a lot cheaper for the stickers; i don\\'t know the usual market price for business cards to compare . sounds very good to me but we also need to put names on the ideas . booked day before , can\\'t take risk . i think my changes will be ready for 24 , not for next monday . can you make a release for you self for monday ? . :slightly_smiling_face: thanks ! i know it\\'s tough to be away from home and appreciate this . for the sticker price we could apparently get 500-1000 from stickermule ( ? ) but possibly requires some tweaking of the images . but does that include the perforating ? because apparently that\\u2019s what costs . you mean assign people to the different tasks ? maybe jyry and i can do the jupyter workshop , radovan and someone else the git workshop (who else is coming ? ) , and for the crossteam , i\\u2019m not sure . aparently , these are cut stickers: <https://www . stickermule . com/products/die-cut-stickers> . i will be at the ahm . thor , great idea for the forward-looking speed blogging session ! i can do crossteam but did not want to monopolize things . yeah it makes most sense that you do the lightning talk , but probably it would be good if at least two of us participated in the hands-on and speed-blogging . yeah it\\u2019s a lot cheaper . 3 by 3 inch is what i was looking at , and we can get 500 from stickermule instead of 100 from the stockholm company . so shall we try stickermule for the stickers , and consider elanders for the postcards and business cards ? yes , i agree . <@u0kv7fvnv>: did we already agree on a location for the next coderefinery sg ? i remember it to be in arlanda , is that correct ? yes that\\u2019s correct ! december 5 at 9:00 . i have to be back in the city at 16:00 so i can fetch the kids while my husband goes to the julbord , sorry for private constraints . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u21ph491q> i\\'ll arrive in ume on the dy4015 today . i have a layover 16:10-18:50 in arn that i plan to spend in the schengen side lounge i have access to in terminal 5 . i arrive at arlanda 19:10 so i will miss out - if you have time can you please update the letsencrypt ? expires tomorrow . but we could either meet for a beer tonight at hotel or tomorrow at breakfast . we discussed moving installation instructions closer to the lessons but after some thought i am not sure about this . the reason is that we would possibly end up with a lot of duplicated instructions: we require git almost everywhere , we require cmake in at least two places . after some thought i feel that we perhaps better keep the instructions in one place but make more clear what components need to be installed for each workshop; for this we will need to change the structure of the install page so that it is organized according to software requirements and not according to operating systems . i will have a go at it but as always welcome suggestions . <@u2k0z6mdg> <@u21ph491q> <@u2k0egsc8> please have a look at <https://coderefinery . github . io/installation/> - is everything you need in there ? are we going to use pycharm ? monday evening i need to send this out to participants . right i knew there was something . i think i\\'m in the same hotel we were during the conference . couldn\\'t book the recommended close by hotel . i\\u2019m in arlanda now but in terminal 4 . flight at 17:45 . we could meet for dinner . i\\'d rather not leave terminal 5 as the lounge has free food and beverages . i don\\'t suppose there\\'s a way to move between terminals airside ? when you mention it i think it makes sense to not split it . having it in one place also reduces the number of mouse clicks needed to go through it . everything i need is in there , but i decided to drop rise from the jupyter part . i can remove it from the instructions . i like the splitting into software rather than os , but it doesn\\u2019t fix one problem: in git-only workshops many of the python packages aren\\u2019t needed . no it\\u2019s not possible . how\\u2019s life treating you in the lounge ? didn\\'t get there yet . ran into a coworker from csc , her baby and her husband who i just learned out was was my coworker years and years ago . <@u23htrtjt> <@u0kv7fvnv> just so i don\\u2019t forget , this evening or tomorrow we should discuss the design of a workshop poster . our technical writer at pdc is also quite good at design , and we need to provide her with some material to get the \\u201cfeel\\u201d right . okay , there\\'s an amex platinum lounge here that i wasn\\'t aware of . agreed , i also have a few finishing touches to put to the staging part of tomorrow\\'s \"basics\" . although i fear we\\'ll never actually get that far in 2 hours . i got rebooked to earlier flight (fog in oslo) might catch you in arlanda; i arrive rather late in umea so probably too late for you guys to meet for dinner . ok , i did bring shoes to go for an early monday morning run though . what i will do is in the schedule i will make more clear which software is needed on which day - agree about python - we can and should indicate there what packages are needed for which part . cr*p i knew i forgot something . didn\\u2019t bring gear either unfortunately . i guess i am in umea around 10 pm , if you still feel like meeting , let me know - otherwise we meet tomorrow . i think i\\u2019ll spend the evening preparing the git-collab , so let\\u2019s meet at breakfast . sure . jyry what\\u2019s your mobile number ? i don\\u2019t seem to have it . mine is +46 73 242 1159 . i have nothing to add for the git intro part . <@u23htrtjt> i do not see that you have made a release for git intro . please make sure to use the gh-pages branch as i am not finished with the \"fix_staging_issue_20\" branch . don\\'t worry i will . i also have some points of my own in the staging part , you\\'ll be able to see those tomorrow morning at the latest . ack , good luck ! what time are you having breakfast ? also we have not been very consistent with snapshotting past workshops , my plan is to catch up with that . yes let\\'s talk about it - but i would really like it to be punk unconventional and \"in your face\" following up on the good suggestions we got :slightly_smiling_face: . so essentially the process is that i merge mine for public consumption and then snapshot it *after* the fact just in case i make last minute typo-fixes ? <https://jakevdp . github . io/blog/2012/10/07/xkcd-style-plots-in-matplotlib/> . possibly with multiple unscientific phenomenae visualized . but more seriously though , i just realized that since we have an internal billing code for these we could also just ask individuals of the csc marketing team to do stuff . imo: if it is typo , it is ok for the latest public to be different from the snapshot . the flow and content may be more of a concern . the snapshotting is so that people who attended a workshop and want to revisit the material 2 months later , have the chance to see the material as is - however i don\\'t fully understand the issue now with releases , imo you can both work on the material , send prs , and we will make sure that prs are integrated after tomorrow\\'s workshop to not change things at last second . i think that is a good idea - i am personally interested in this but have to admit that i might not have the time so if we can offload it , then that\\'s a good idea . guys , we should get into the habit doing all changes via prs that are always reviewed by others - i know that in last minute situations we need to cut corners , and i have also too often sinned and pushed directly but we need to eat our own medicine; i will really try to follow this myself . again , really depends on what and how . bad configs are not so simple to determine , especially as the other worked fine on my jekyll . i didn\\'t mean the git-intro config issue; that is hard to detect - i meant content , this was general goal that i also give to myself , not based on anything today . hmm ... hmmhmm ... maybe we need to redefine the process a bit . :slightly_smiling_face: ? why ? what speaks against prs ? gh_pages is what is visible and to avoid too heavy a process we let each teacher pull to that to effect a workshop . then *master* is where the golden standard of \"yeah this is what we think rocks\" and can be pulled to from gh_pages (or some other branch) by pr . ... and should obviously be the basis of all new branches . imo gh_pages is the central trusted place and all prs should be directed towards it; of course it slows things down but we then get some feedback functionality to discuss new changes , otherwise they just happen . the alternative would be to host somwhere like readthedocs that also builds other branches . then we could try something out once without putting it in gh_pages . good point - the advantage of rtd is that it can serve multiple branches . let\\'s think and talk about it soon and let us now get some beauty sleep for a great workshop tomorrow . i\\'m so handsome i don\\'t need beauty sleep . see you earlyish in the morning at breakfast . it opens at 6:30 but that sounds a bit early , maybe 7ish ? haha - yes - are you coming over to bjorken hotel for breakfast ? maybe i misremembered something so we are all in the same hotel ? nope , i\\'m in the centrum where we were last time . ok but you will come here for breakfast ? when ? map says that we are super close to the venue , i would say 7:20 . ok , i\\'ll try to leave here around 7 so i may be a bit later than you two . ok . how is everything ? . jyry , radovan and i are in ume\\xe5 teaching git . it\\u2019s going well so far ! good local organization , around 16 participants . good . <@u2k0z6mdg> have a look at what made up about staging area ? ack . can you please send a pull request . ahh , it\\'s already on gh-pages as i presented it a couple of hours ago . if possible i\\'d bring the concept of storytelling out earlier . and possibly skip the \"write the name of a storyteller on a note\" . ok , i will fetch it . few personal impressions: i think we should not go into . git internals too much , we need to insist that people set up their editors and ssh keys ahead of time - we lost some time due to that , also we should try to not scare them too much with the complexity of git but try to keep things very simple and only later unveil the complexity or simplicity depending on viewpoint . we had 20 attendants , all of them seemed to stay , good questions and engagement , great local support , great work by jyry and thor . i typed up the feedback under coderefinery-&gt;workshops -&gt; umea-2017-oct . very positive overall , but with good points we should consider . for example \\u201cadd 5 minutes here and there to play around by oneself\\u201d . congrads . thanks ! very nice feedback and indeed very good suggestions , also the commit -v is good . great job ! also the comment about better marketing is good , indeed i really suck at that part . yes , the infamous \"play with yourself\" -moments . <@u0kv7fvnv>: i guess you are already familiar with the software impact project at the escience center in the netherlands ? <https://www . dropbox . com/s/vml9wuopmmvf5ae/2017-10-13%20impact%20%28esac%29 . pptx ? dl=0> . thanks for sharing this - i was semi-aware but it is good to be reminded and we should link to these initiatives . yes , please add a link , is this also something we should discuss more for coderefinery2 ? we can discuss it - personally i think this is a very high level project that affects research long-term and indirectly - and it is important - i am personally more interested in more down to earth services which researchers can relate to , i have 3-4 on my mind that would definitely fly and are easy to set up technically , so far we managed 0 . 5 from these 3-4; so before brainstorming about new ventures i would personally try to get the other 3 . 5 ideas to fly first :slightly_smiling_face: . but of course it is not about me - but in the to be drafted project directive i will motivate why i think that down to earth services would also be interesting for neic . could be small things , just lift other good projects we know of and advertise them , just cross linking from each other . i have simple things in mind which could become big things - we lack resources , not ideas :slightly_smiling_face: . but this should not invalidate the idea above (software impact) which is also a good idea . hey , have u heard of r shiny (<https://shiny . rstudio . com/tutorial/>) could it be interesting in context of workshops ? yes , and we could use shiny knowledge inside csc . volunteers are welcome :slightly_smiling_face: . mmm ... :slightly_smiling_face: . thanks ! i did not know this before . i have installed this for our users , but not a user my self . anyone know why two words in my latest commit highlighted in red (<https://github . com/coderefinery/installation/commit/9c9012731476f1f8c293a6e348779bce02688634>) . the two words appear green when viewed as html . hope i do not have googlle . syntax highlighting ? maybe \"else\" would also be in red . website looks good ? then i would not worry . in the website it\\'s green . i do not like that . i do not see any special thing with these two words , they in middle of a paragraph infact . please post a link to the website so that i know what precisely you mean . <https://coderefinery . github . io/installation/git/> . the dabian/ubuntu block . aha now i understand: you are still inside the shell code block ! look for triple quotes , hence the \"if\" and \"then\" . looking . finding ? :slightly_smiling_face: . i see , still wondering what made these , there is nothing in the file i commited . and how to get rid of it . the triple quotes mark code blocks , you told jekyll that the whole section is a code block , see the box: <https://coderefinery . github . io/installation/git/#installation-on-linux;> solution: move the sentence \"check the version after installing\" and the paragraph outside of the code block . < ! channel> <@u2k0z6mdg> has touched on a very important question: git or git ? let the fight begin ! \"you\" can mean you or somebody else , does not matter now who did it :slightly_smiling_face: . git . git . <https://github . com/git/git/blob/master/readme . md> . unless we mean command line . we have this problem in other lessons where a codeblock includes some text , e . g . a commit message . see for example <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-intro/04-branches/> . i prefer to call programs the way the authors call them . but no strong feelings either way . words like do , then , let are green , so this markdown flavor uses bash syntax highlighting . right ? linus at least used to consistently write lowercase . but maybe the community has come to an agreement about the first letter while i wasn\\'t looking . yes , related issue but there the problem is not that text is accidentally in a code block but rather that the highlighting is wrong which can be tweaked . i will fix it and opening a issue , for me the main repo is the truth and they use \"git\" . i did the refactor because , i wanted to separate the git as system to git a command or program . did not htink that deep . no sure that\\u2019s intentional of course . maybe it can be fixed . i mean where fixing is needed . relived that <@u0kv7fvnv> did not have a strong feeling . others i could handle . yes , seeing radovan cry is hard for all of us . but sure , caps when talking about the system , and lowercase when talking about the program/tool . still nicer experience than seeing linus torvalds cry . 5/5 would pay to see that . uh , forgot lunch will be back soon . <@u2k0egsc8> a candidate for the mma session ? <http://www . isc-hpc . com/press-releases/calling-on-experts-to-propose-tutorials-and-workshops-for-isc-2018 . html> . hmm ... full-day sessions , i don\\'t suppose our spanking new git-in-a-day workshop might be a candidate for that ? right , pick a arbitrary matlab application and port it to python . for all compute intensive parts , replace with pybind11 and a c++ multithreaded libraries . move c++ libraries to a heterogenous platform . there you go , three day mma tutorial ! more modular software requirements: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-10-24-aarhus/#schedule> . is this better or worse than before ? (as always honest answer is what i need) . i think it clutters up the schedule a bit too much . what about adding a header with \\u201csoftware requirements\\u201d or something similar in a visible place on the site ? ok will rearrange . i like the idea of highlighting the requirements on the workshop pages , with links to each requirement in the installation repo . another thing i just thought of , it would probably help to have at the top of each software requirement a link to the windows , osx and linux sections . i am now going through the pleasure of ordering coffee for aarhus workshop: buggy php page where i seem to have to type every single of the 6 orders separately; absolute last time i agree to organize a workshop in a place where we have nobody locally taking care of this . so that one doesn\\u2019t need to scroll down . problem with the latter suggestion is that we also have some info outside of the os sections . what about having those links in a list below the general information , and have links to the other information as well . e . g . for git , have the list of links just above \\u201cinstallation on linux\\u201d , and include links to \\u201chow to verify the installation\\u201d , \\u201cconfiguring git\\u201d and \\u201csetting up ssh keys\\u201d . next try: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-10-24-aarhus/#software-requirements> . other suggestions welcome but they have to come via pr :slightly_smiling_face: i need to move on to other exciting things like wrestling with the coffee order form :disappointed: . yes i like this . i think the heading should even stay red to make it extra clear . i like your suggestions but my time is up so please don\\'t take that as rejection . we have to make it a requirement otherwise we say no - i am so frustrated wasting time with this that i could spend developing lessons . nono , it\\u2019s already much better . solution: use chrome duplicate to duplicate pages so that i don\\'t have to re-enter everything 6x . nope , website header does not like to be duplicated , have to re-enter everything . yeah - i broke the site , wtf ! maybe you can call in the order instead of filling web form ? :slightly_smiling_face: . good idea , i wrote a desperate email asking about alternative ways of ordering the catering; i think i broke their site by submitting from two tabs with same header :slightly_smiling_face: . :smile: :smile: :smile: . dear team , please submit prs from forks , not branches otherwise i have to clean them up later (not much work but requires some thinking and checking whether a branch is still in use or already integrated) . rephrasing: please submit prs from branches on forks , not branches in the main repos . <@u0kv7fvnv> the best practice is to delete the branch when you merge it . there\\'s a button on gh for just that . good point , i will do that in future - with the hope that i don\\'t forget to do that please ignore the above and continue as before . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u21ph491q> i spoke to our graphics designer and she\\'s available to do work as long as there\\'s an internal billing code attached and everybody is happy . especially as we have a limited amount of graphics design work to offer and she likes that part of her work . thanks ! before engaging we would however need a rough ball park price tag . it\\'s going to be x hours . just like asking for me to do an 8 hour job etc . i can ask her how long things usually take , i have no idea whatsoever . rough order of magnitude estimate will be sufficient . what should i ask for ? a poster with punk attitude ? a series of posters with punk attitude ? you could ask for an estimate for one poster and for a series of 3 posters . thank you . with a common visual look i suppose ? yes - can be small variations in slogans but it would be cool to get a nice series \\xe0 la absolut vodka series :slightly_smiling_face: . ok that\\u2019s great . i also contacted the pdc person but let\\u2019s let csc take it . i\\u2019m not sure our technical writer is good at punk\\u2026 . <@u23htrtjt> , on starting \\u2018jekyll serve\\u2019 in the ides-testing repository , i get this error: conversion error: jekyll::converters::scss encountered an error while converting \\u2018assets/css/style . scss\\u2019: invalid us-ascii character \\u201c\\\\xe2\\u201d on line 5 . any advice ? it is only \\u2018}\\u2019 on line 5 . circumvented by vagrant and and ubuntu distro\\u2026 . did you check if there is any copywrite issues withe photo .. imo(personal) the focus on the photo is too much and too less on corse content and who this is for . is the problem solved ? and just checking: the plan is not to develop the ide-testing further but just take inspiration from that , right ? right . at least based on my understanding . because i really want to have two separate lessons: one for testing , one for ide (the ide can have testing as an example) . the reason is that it separates concerns and we want to be able to give the testing lesson separately if requested . in other words: testing is relevant to everybody , even the \"vi\" people; but testing is also a good example for ides . yes , \"vi\" is not an ide . vim is . thanks for clarifying . as i looked through the ide&amp;&amp;test , i got the question of what to include . the problem is not gone , though . it is a style . scss somewhere , causing this . probably as part of my rvm installation on my mac . i will check the encoding issue . unfriendly website but friendly staff - managed to order via email . i get it on the <http://neic . no|neic . no> repo as well . where is that file even ? can you send a web link to that file/line ? i am not able to reproduce this , problem is possibly still there but hard to debug . that is the problem . where is this file: . dhcp-075043:<http://neic . no|neic . no> bjornlin$ jekyll serve configuration file: /volumes/mythunderboltduo/kontoret/src/neic . no/_config . yml source: /volumes/mythunderboltduo/kontoret/src/neic . no destination: /volumes/mythunderboltduo/kontoret/src/neic . no/_site incremental build: disabled . enable with --incremental generating ... conversion error: jekyll::converters::scss encountered an error while converting \\u2018assets/css/style . scss\\u2019: invalid us-ascii character \\u201c\\\\xe2\\u201d on line 5 jekyll 3 . 5 . 2 | error: invalid us-ascii character \\u201c\\\\xe2\" on line 5 . .. and here: . dhcp-075043:ides-testing bjornlin$ jekyll serve configuration file: /volumes/mythunderboltduo/kontoret/src/coderefinery/ides-testing/_config . yml deprecation: the \\u2018gems\\u2019 configuration option has been renamed to \\u2018plugins\\u2019 . please update your config file accordingly . source: . destination: . /_site incremental build: disabled . enable with --incremental generating ... conversion error: jekyll::converters::scss encountered an error while converting \\u2018assets/css/style . scss\\u2019: invalid us-ascii character \\u201c\\\\xe2\\u201d on line 5 jekyll 3 . 5 . 2 | error: invalid us-ascii character \\u201c\\\\xe2\" on line 5 . try this: <https://github . com/csswizardry/inuit . css/issues/270#issuecomment-56056606> . solved with export lang=\\u201cen_us . utf-8\\u201d and export lc_all=\\u201cen_us . utf-8\" . thx ! cool ! i had similar issues with python and after lots of head scratching this solved it for me too . yes let\\u2019s open a new thread (note that pushing the regular thread button on your last comment will only add another comment , not thread) . we had one cancellation to aarhus , i replied to the ticket in zendesk . i\\u2019ll go ahead and invite the next person from the waiting list . <@u0kv7fvnv> have you sent out installation instructions ? can you send it also to <mailto:a . parola@unito . it|a . parola@unito . it> . for i in $(replies) ;do move_to_thread i ;done . excellent ! thanks for taking care of this - i have sent them out , here is the email that i have sent: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1zjgvsecfm0stilqzqubrzdc750qcrvmr2gdx0lqimsi/> . where is slackbot when i meet it . we can create another template where we bump a person from waiting to confirmed . i would send the install instructions in the same email as the email inviting the waiting person . :slightly_smiling_face: . yeah let\\u2019s do that in the future . now i\\u2019ll send two emails to the guy . ok that\\'s completely fine - thanks for the emailing . it feels like we\\u2019re becoming more and more like a well oiled machine ! i can definitely feel the relief - of course now more work for you but it is really appreciated . <@u21ph491q> our graphics person is busy with pre-existing work for the next couple of weeks at least . just to vacation-proof the arrangement: <@u5l3ena15> i\\'ve spoken with aino-riikka corell in case someone needs to talk to her in my absence . ok , i think i\\u2019ll ask genet (the pdc writer) to create something for link\\xf6ping then . is svg supported in git pages . it\\'s a file to serve staticly just as any other . why wouldn\\'t it be ? wonder it will render , let me try it . yes it will , we use it in our git lessons . ack , i mad a illustration for git staging . with big hopes . let\\'s see how others see it . try \"git grep svg\" . hmmmm .... we need good text but we also need good design . ok the above sentence is not very nice - not so cool what i do here: criticize people\\'s work in their absence; let me rephrase: i think the design of the poster still needs some work - i am personally very interested in typography and design and have sometimes a bit strong opinion on this . in this case it was the specs i wrote which would be difficult for most designers: \\u201cmake it look like we care about code and not design\\u201d . i\\u2019m thinking that we just need *something* for link\\xf6ping , doesn\\u2019t have to be perfect (but of course not terrible either) . or does anyone have a better suggestion ? i would like to get full attendance in link\\xf6ping . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u23htrtjt> i have pushed a branch improve_02basics , (no pull request sent) , please let me know what you thing about my additions . good point - let us not get blocked by perfectionism . what i recommend to do is to send a pull request with the title \"[wip] sometitle\" - then it is clear to us that we should not merge yet but can easily review diffs and discuss them - thanks sabry ! done . good idea . use this message for thread discussion . i like it ! approved . thanks . i can now reveal that my wife made it . wanted your honest opinion first :wink: . thanks for preparing it - it is clean and clear . how did the story telling part go in the git intro lecture , . <@u0kv7fvnv> can i merge the pull request in git intro ? . merged - we ideally want other people to merge . yes , that\\'s why i asked . by the way is it ok if i change the story telling part in branching and merging , we can bring it back after aathus . it is definitely ok to change everything - submit a pr , we look at it and talk about it and then we merge . <@u0kv7fvnv> should i say a bit more on revert and reset under basics or is it better to have a new short section . good idea , i think it belongs to basics since this is something one wants to do early in the git career and it is good to show what solution to use or not to use when . <@u2k0z6mdg> off for a 3 week holiday . if you can find someone else to review i\\'d appreciate . will bring laptop along so if i *must* i can review from underneath a palm somewhere by the pool in florida . ok , enjoy . in git pages , how to display the schedule in local preview . it generates automatically in git hub , but could not figure out when viewing on local jekyll . can you please share a link of what schedule you mean precisely ? i believe we have one person still on waiting list for aarhus , should we invite him/her \"hoping\" that somebody will not show up with the small \"risk\" that we are one more than comfortable ? otherwise we should inform the person that it did not work out - both is fair , just want to avoid that we don\\'t write at all . the schedule in this page <https://coderefinery . github . io/git-intro/> . that should work locally the same way - it doesn\\'t ? i do not see it when i star locally . what do you see when you run locally ? no errors either . what index page is shown on your side ? and on your fork ? you could debug it there and send pr once it looks good on the fork . on the folk it is ok , as i said github renders it . my curiosity was why not locally . i thought i might needed to see something extra . it is not a big issue , yeah i vote for inviting the second person of the waiting list since we didn\\u2019t hear back from the first one . and we might get some no-shows . ok for me . ok i will answer . great that he accepted ! it does for me locally as well , so there must be something a bit odd . one more thing for us to do this week: write abstracts for the ahm2018 git-novice and jupyter tutorials . registration will open next monday and people will select which workshop they want to attend . osl airport , landing in cph 15:00 . my mobile: 0047 93870788 . <@u0kv7fvnv> there are 2 pull requests , shall we merge ? i am now again online and will have a look . ok . merged , thanks for the great work ! and we got one cancellation in my inbox so it worked out nicely :slightly_smiling_face: . on the train to hotel from airport i will send a nother pull with commit-v , apart from that i am not planing to change anything else . great - thank you . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u2k0egsc8> <@u2k0z6mdg> are you going out for dinner ? i just arrived to wakeup . thx . just arrived@cph . will hit the bed when i get to wakeup later tonight . i just met thor in the hallway - i already had dinner but we might meet for a beer later; sabry let us know if you want to join . just arrived at the hotel , too tiered today . i on tommorow night . ok let\\'s have dinner together tomorrow - my plan is to walk by foot tomorrow morning , looks like 30 min walk , leaving no later than 8 (let\\'s meet at lobby) , hope you see you at breakfast ! today i have drafted a software licensing lecture: <https://github . com/coderefinery/software-licensing> - feedback/suggestions very welcome (here or email or via issues); link to slides: <http://cicero . xyz/v2/remark/github/coderefinery/software-licensing/master/talk . md/> . good stuff ! i made a few issues with possible typos . thanks a lot for the issues ! i will make another pass but am quite relieved that this one is almost done , tomorrow i got to work on the testing lesson :slightly_smiling_face: not happy about providing a bad example with last minute work :slightly_smiling_face: . we\\u2019re all guilty of that . nice slides ! some comments , from experience: * would be nice to mention that proprietary licenses/eulas also exist * would be nice to have a comparative chart of s/w licenses (i haven\\'t seen any that i\\'d like , though) * make clear that cc is not quite a software license * ownership depends not just on country; even within a country it can vary depending on the employer (public vs private) * a good message would be that licenses protect both authors and softwares: e . g ., public license releases the original author from all responsibilities , and does not guarantee that software does what it was intended to do; the other end of the spectrum is a guaranteed service and responsibility for bugfixing . and btw , i dislike zenodo\\'s way of assigning dois to tarballs - software is not a tarball . and not everybody develops in github . thanks for the good feedback - i will incorporate it . just for my own education and to improve the slides: <@u075ur7j4> are you aware of any tool that is generally available and can be used for code citation other than zenodo/figshare ? most of your suggestions implemented and acknowledged :slightly_smiling_face: the remaining ones i will do soon . <@u0kv7fvnv>: i only heard of zenodo and figshare myself , i wish i knew of other ways . let me know if you find some ! there is no link yet to zenodo on the coderefinery link page . it\\'s here: <http://coderefinery . org/contact/> edit: my misunderstanding . oh i completely misunderstood , sorry; yes you are right . what we need are best practice guides on this . today\\u2019s feedback now typed up in workshop folder , under aarhus-2017-oct . thanks ! home at 01:00 . waiting for my turn <https://www . instagram . com/p/bavfbdnf_of/ ? hl=en&amp;taken-by=ukarundt> a little before 05:00 in the world longest relay <https://www . uka . no/nyheter/14-uka-rundt/> . .. upgraded to \\u201cprofessor\\u201d:grinning: . wow - long day ! awesome project ! cool ! how did it go ? <https://research . google . com/colaboratory/> . yes , this is really cool . it should be included in the jupyter lesson . winter arrived here: 20 cm snow in the city , today traveling to helsinki for d-wave course . 20cm ?! starting with a bang . we have beautiful autumn colors and sunshine , but very windy . <@u0kv7fvnv> , <@u2k0z6mdg> have you booked a hotel in link\\xf6ping yet ? i found that frimuraren is very expensive , and \\u201cbest western plus priceless hotel\\u201d is cheaper and highly rated . ok thanks for info - haven\\'t booked yet but plan to do so today . i booked the best western . ok i will go for that one , stayed there once or twice , it\\'s good and super central . great . i\\u2019ll drive from stockholm , so we don\\u2019t have to take a bus in the mornings . awesome ! some suggestions for next week course: . let us in particular fix known issues and react to feedback . i will update git bisect exercise and further streamline testing lesson . in the git collab i recommend to not only emphasize code quality and trust but also learning opportunity through code review . in the git intro we need a logical flow of sections , go possibly faster in the very intro part and go slower with the branches . when motivating git , it is important to emphasize reproducibility . we should have a look at install instruction issues and then send it out by tomorrow . good points . in git we should also emphasize what is pure git and what comes from the web services . yes . thanks for reminding . which airport is better to use , arn+train or lpi . i\\u2019ve never flown to lpi but i would expect that it doesn\\u2019t have frequent connections . the train takes around 2 . 5h . but try the airport first ! flying to lpi is expensive . ack . sabry , are you staying for entire workshop ? what do we do with the ide session ? i will update website and rearrange last day and move cmake to the afternoon . i will go for arn and train . \"stockholm\" skavsta might be yet another cheap option . just read up on the feedback from aarhus: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/11vkk-rfm5xym-mvidcgwxqsewriz97k04owzjumyjvk/> - very good feedback and very useful feedback , we should have no doubts about what changes to implement , whether we have the time is of course another story but i will try to follow the advice we got . thanks to thor for typing it up . we seem to be indeed converging . <@u0kv7fvnv> let you in30 min , in a meeting negotiating this . no problem , this is async communication , take time to figure things out . and also what to do about cmake , i guess you\\u2019ll take it radovan ? yes i can take that one , but i have no time to prepare ide so unless somebody else takes it , we need to drop it this time . i think yes , we drop it this time and think later about what to do with it . we have a meeting today right ? oh yes , fail by me , i am at airport waiting for delayed flight so i cannot easily join but perhaps it is useful if you guys briefly discuss without me - but feel also free to postpone if that is globally better . ok , hope your flight departs soon ! hotels in linkoping are insanely expensive , what is going on there ? < ! channel> we should have at least a short meeting today at the usual place , even if radovan can\\u2019t join . probably not that much to discuss but good to touch base . i got a room for 1080 sek . the best western one . including breakfast , so cheaper than the \\u201clow-cost\\u201d aarhus one we stayed in ! it seems it is either not avaialble anymore or not available through our egencia , but i will book a hotel nearby , cheapest is at 1300 nok - shock . ack . thanks for holding the meeting . you\\u2019re\\u2026 welcome ? :wink: hope you had a good flight . i made a release for 2017 aarhus workshop git-intro as i need to change somethings , hope this is . <@u0kv7fvnv> i will be in link\\xf6ping 6th night and leave 8th night . sorry could not be there on the 9th . not a good travel day yesterday , 7 hours delay in total and bag lost on the way . <@u21ph491q> i will update the linkoping workshop website tonight - will write you once it\\'s done . ... ok ? yes it is :slightly_smiling_face: i need to finally snapshot a number of past workshops . i was planning to do it today actually , and use your new template with the sw requirements . so i can do it , no problem . ok , that will definitely help; i recommend to use meld or similar to align aarhus and linkoping so that we have the links , cmake moves to afternoon , ide is this time out , pycharm out of the install links . thank you . registration for neic ahm 2018 open: <https://neicnordic . github . io/ahm18 . neic . nordforsk . org/> - deadline for registration is 24 . 11 . 2017 . do you have any control over the site ? the menu could be little more prominent . i guess everybody has control over the site by fork-pr :slightly_smiling_face: but more practically , you can let <#c5yk6376g|ahm-planning> know . ack . in other words i am also not part of the org committee but thor is . <@u2k0z6mdg> you mean the top menu with home , schedule , etc ? i can forward it to the ahm-planning people who are in charge of it . i created prs on the installation instructions and the website (updates to link\\xf6ping workshop page) , can someone review and merge ? maybe add as issue in case somebody watches them ? done . i have pending prs on installation-instructions and the workshop website . after they\\u2019re merged i think we\\u2019re ready to send out the email , or do you want to do something first <@u0kv7fvnv> . i feel important to know has control over these things . merged - thanks a lot ! only think i overlooked in the pr is that cmake is in the afternoon . apart from that good to send out . ah yes , sorry forgot about cmake moving to afternoon . hmm , <@u0kv7fvnv> the github page for the installation instructions hasn\\u2019t updated after the merge (the separate jupyter section doesn\\u2019t show up) . any ideas why ? problem is i can\\u2019t go to settings on this repo to see if any possible github-pages errors occured (i\\u2019m not admin ? ) . interesting , i made a dummy commit , and that seems to have triggered the rebuild . actually this rings a bell , a merged pr does not trigger a rebuild , only git push . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u2k0z6mdg> we have 20 registrations to link\\xf6ping and one helper , results from typeform here: <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/pzqniw/pae9xepzhqv2vwcq> some observations: only 1 windows user , 90% familiar with git , 75% use python , 70% use make (30% cmake) , 100% familiar with cli . i think that is surprising at least to me . thanks ! that is great - i would say we can then probably go deeper in git and cmake then , very nice . challenge: we need a coderefinery jack-o\\'-lantern . <@u2k0z6mdg> i think it would be nice to show visual git diff or visual conflict resolution in the git-intro part . if preparation time allows . meaning git difftool and git mergetool - i think these are really useful for nontrivial diffs and merges . another input to the git-intro session: yesterday i went through the software carpentry lesson on git (<http://swcarpentry . github . io/git-novice/>) since i was doing my instructor teaching demo . i think it\\u2019s worth carefully studying this material since the order of things and how they\\u2019re explained is quite perfect . :joy: i never made one before . maybe too late now , but def next year . i agree , we could also use or reuse carpentry material; i was never a fan of the dracula example but that is just my personal taste - it is definitely a well converged material since it has been field tested in possibly hundreds of workshops . there is hardly anything for me to teach) :simple_smile: . ack , i was bit reluctant with the carpentries foot as remotes come much earlier . i think it is good to introduce remotes after we are comfortable working locally , we need to understand branches and conflicts before going into remotes imo . exactly . i think the git intro is always important ! even though people use git they like the intro , it\\u2019s been like that in all previous workshops . i agree , some people are still new to git and for the git experts it is good to really understand branches and staging . <@u2234ay5a> can you share the login details for coderefinery on linkedin ? i\\u2019m thinking of sharing the workshop poster . i\\'ve added you as admin , so please try going to this page . and press \"manage page\" . no extra passwords or logins . your regular linkedin account should do . <https://www . linkedin . com/company/coderefinery ? report%2esuccess=kj_kkfgtdcfmt-a7wv3fn9yvgwr02kd6azhgx4bqcdip6-2rfp2oxyvoeqiprcaq7bf> . the link . thanks ! <@u2234ay5a> , in the feedback from aarhus regarding the ide session , a participant suggest to do the session like the jupyter notebook . i think this is an good idea . should we develop a more hands-on ide-session for the espoo ws ? (we = you and i ) . i have nothing against . .. meaning you are positive or indifferent ? there has been several attempts to make it better , so more of a positive . maybe this will be ven better . hpc course week starts today and will be out of radar for some time . hi ! i hear you guys are leaning heavily on the gsuite , just like tryggve . we just had something nasty happen . google just pulled the publicly accessible (linked/indexed/disseminated) tryggve2 project directive off the internet , redirecting visitors to an unsightly notice that tryggve has breached terms of service . google took this action without cause and without informing first (or at all) , and with no explanation what exactly was in breach of tos , nor giving a chance to correct it , and frankly i have no idea whether this is the only document that has been pulled . apparently , this may be due to a bug in the abuse bot . cf discussion in <#c054ulhes|tryggve> <https://neic . slack . com/archives/c054ulhes/p1509627703000383> . thanks for spreading the word ! it hasn\\u2019t happened to us , yet , but we should discuss whether to take any action . thanks for the note ! sorry for the troubles . very curious . i definitely welcome nordic/in-house solution for collaborative document storage over one where we rely on a company on a different continent; some might say that we have one in form of a wiki but that is not a practical solution for me; once we know more about why this happened to tryggve , we can re-evaluate . also i don\\'t think we use google as dissemination channel , but rather as internal document store for drafting and collaborative editing; dissemination happens via the neic and/or project websites imo . good luck ! when you met this monday , have you scheduled the next meeting time ? we have the request to offer a workshop in lund , i am unsure whether we have the resources (in other words whether we have enough instructors and whether we have the time) . this would be some time 2018 . probably in addition to our already very ambitious schedule . i am personally skeptical , already next week will be tough with 3 people , i am personally quite on the limit . the location (lund) definitely makes sense - what is your opinion ? hands-on is nice but it is not easy with ide since it is then naturally language-specific and whatever language you choose , some people will fall of the boat; in other words i am skeptical but i would love to be proven wrong . it would be great if we could offer a hands-on experience covering perhaps the top 3 languages , not only python . for a demo it matters less , of course the same could be said about jupyter but jupyter is not only for python and people who are completely new to python don\\'t have to do more than clicking a button to go through . but again: please prove me wrong . but perhaps we should try less hard to be language agnostic and rather focus on presenting useful tools such as an ide - long story short: i don\\'t know the right answer and we need to try things :slightly_smiling_face: . nice message i got via linkedin: . \"i participated in the code refinery workshop at aarhus last week . thank you very much for a good course ! the workshop has inspired me to explore further into software development . \" . i will be able to commit a more constant contribution next year . as i am renegotiating my work load . . but from . february . as i will be away december and january as my wife will be having a baby . i am very happy for you guys that is great news ! it would not be before february , i aim more for late spring . basically what i want to avoid is that i push people into unrealistic commitments and overtime . i need to open registration for espoo workshop basically now . who apart from jyry , bj\\xf8rn , and me will be around and what sessions would you like to be involved in ? ack . cmake again . i will work with <@u2234ay5a> on the ide . lund in the spring is wonderful , but i should keep my mouth shut since i am probably needed at home in spring\\u201918 . for next week workshop: do we have two-color sets of sticky notes ? <http://www . datacarpentry . org/blog/carpcon-announce/> . i also want to avoid pushing me into unrealistic commitments; we might end up with 18-19 workshops over the course of the project and if i go to all of them , with all love to this project , the rest of my work and life suffers . i will only agree to the lund workshop if it is realistic to run it without me; i will probably be there and teach but i don\\'t want to create all these commitments that depend on me . your life should not suffer . make it a project goal of not going to more than half of the ws\\u201918 . that\\'s a very good goal . with the current schedule , lund is only doable in october/november next year . i agree , i don\\'t see a possibility of pressing it before summer . in october our current project is already over so i cannot make any commitments . there will most likely be a follow-up but we don\\'t know yet in which form - to be drafted and brainstormed . ok . i though we ended on 31 dec\\u201918 . if it is october , we are fully booked . there is probably some wrap up like reporting in september/october . exactly , there will be reporting to do - i think i have to say no to lund workshop , we don\\'t have the people , that\\'s life . i will try to improve reproducibility material . if we have enough content , then we could include it in the workshop as well . is it more probably that we can offer it or more probably that we will not have time ? i need to create the website today , of course we can still remove it but let us be realistic . offering a single session is possible i have enough material for it . how about having a single session in espoo workshop and based on the feedback the material can be further developed ? ok , yes only single session , it is a good idea to grow lessons iteratively . more feedback: \"thank you for the great workshop ! i enjoyed it a lot\" . started drafting project directive for follow-up coderefinery: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1j2_wxgjkiih6gohjoknzqglrgnikqhu8c9ojczklpys/> (in root of our drive); please contribute ideas and shape how you would like the future of the project to be , do not take anything for granted or written in stone , feel free to edit everything you see there . another \"thank you very much for organizing this workshop . i learnt a lot from it . \" . imagine you will lead it instead of me (not an unlikely scenario) - what would you do differently ? write it down there . who\\'s going to take thor\\'s git collab , documentation , and jupyter ? registration now open , let your friends/colleagues know . hey , sorry late participation , i was really sick yesterday but fever-free today . regarding lund , yes it does seem that we\\u2019re fully booked . the only workaround would be to shift the uppsala workshop to lund (that\\u2019s may 2018) . but we probably don\\u2019t want to do that . yes , unfortunately i have to skip espoo . but i\\u2019m interested in contributing to the reproducibility material with harsha . i can bring stickies . interesting ! would be good to attend . thank you ! glad you feel better , no rush in answering , health first . i think the reproducibility material will be very valuable . espoo registration open , first registration in . add an idea about a \"discussion forum\" . excellent idea , please add it to the document with a sentence or two - this is not to offload work on you , it\\'s to get better input . what i meant was i added . no we didn\\u2019t , thought it would be good to get your input on it . shall we have it monday next week (after link\\xf6ping) , nov 13 ? :slightly_smiling_face: great , thank you . unfortunately i have another trip then (i am completely traveled out :disappointed: but nov 20 is fine . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u2k0z6mdg> i was wondering , is it ok if i show up around 11am in link\\xf6ping ? the reason is that that way i can drop sofia in kindergarten before leaving (thus help my wife) . but this will leave to you to find the room etc\\u2026 . sure no problem at all . ok , <@u0kv7fvnv> do you know the place well ? nope , i don\\'t know the place at all :slightly_smiling_face: . ok , then we will improvise , :slightly_smiling_face: we will figure it out . i will be in <http://www . fawltytowers . se/> +47 96752679 . actually , it now turns out my daughter won\\u2019t be going to kindergarten on tuesday either . she still has 40 c fever . so i can leave stockholm early tuesday morning , my wife will have to be home anyways . so i can pick you up at the hotel and we drive to the campus . sabry are you staying in the same hotel ? wish her quick recovery , if it is 40 c you should try to get to down to a safer point . i am staying in scandic link\\xf6ping v\\xe4st , linkoping . i think you should give her paracetamol or better ibuprofen (children dose) , if it is 40 . oh wow , i am sorry to hear that , always health first so if it\\'s better that you stay home , don\\'t worry about the workshop - wishing a quick recovery . new pull request sent for git-instro . merged , thank you . thanks , i see that you trust me more now . :slightly_smiling_face: i always trusted you , and actually i did read through the changes . there is this quote by lenin i like: \"trust but verify\" :slightly_smiling_face: . thank you , there are few more typos , will fix if find time . thanks for your concern . we\\u2019ve given her paracetamol and ibuprofen when the fever\\u2019s gotten too high . hopefully it starts going down tomorrow , it\\u2019s already been 3 days of high fever\\u2026 . more motivation \"thank you [ ... ] for the workshop . it was a great learning experiences on many new things . git , jupyter , automated testing and cmake were new to me and the workshop helps me a lot as i have started using these tools for my work now . \" . <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u2k0z6mdg> so i missed something in my last minute planning . i have the stickies , but i won\\u2019t be coming until 10:30 tomorrow . the stickies are very important in the git-intro , so i asked weine and torben (two application experts i\\u2019ve been talking to about our visit) whether they can bring some tomorrow morning . i\\u2019ll now write to the helper and ask him . ah don\\'t worry , i found some backup stickies in my bag , but thanks - sorry i did not tell you . sabry , i suggest bus number 20 , 8:10 from train station - you can also call me and we can talk about it (sent you a text) . so do you have enough stickies for the morning ? yes , we are good . funny how much effort can be spent on those little seemingly insignificant things\\u2026 . ok good ! yes , actually the whole workshop org from start (room) to end (certificates) is a lot of things to keep track of , i have not considered this in the past . update on gitlab: contract got green light from neic side , now waiting for deic side and then we get signatures and can start migrating . update on ci: looks like two persons will be working on this project , more details soon . just arrived at the hotel , train station is far for me . i will try to walk . ok , then disregard my text message to your phone - let\\'s meet then tomorrow there , if everything goes fine i will be there 8:25 . 30 min walk to foo-halen . i like the name \"foo\" . <@u21ph491q> you managed to get a pr to your lesson on prs right after your lesson: <https://github . com/coderefinery/git-collaborative/pull/16> - mission accomplished ! csc guys , i really need your help in getting the word out: so far we have 1 registration; based on our experience that does not mean that nobody is interested in the course but it rather means that nobody knows about it . awesome ! ok , i\\'d say nobody knows about it . i\\'ll start discussing with our communications people . jussi asked me two weeks ago whether the reg was open , at that time it wasn\\'t and i was ultra busy in aarhus so the only thing i could point him to was the notify-me; so possibly things got announced but we were not registrable during the short post-email attention span . thanks to thor and sabry for a great workshop - many people stayed to the very end and were happy and excited and promised to spread the propaganda to their friends and colleagues . i will send info to richard so that he can spread the word at aalto . we got another good pr to our material without asking , brilliant . dear all , we need to plan the remaining workshops , please mark your interests and availability here: <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1a5meleqvuonjnhzpjniq2tacq9wtgf58bzbobfia0z0/> . background: we need to realistically judge whether we have enough resources to deliver the workshops . it is very tough for me to go to all workshops and pull 40%-50% of the schedule . if we realize we do not have resources , we will have to cancel workshops . but no pressure , realistic is better than optimistic . and thanks to you as well ! i hope the cmake session went well . how many stayed for it ? i think it went well - \"surprising\" number of people stayed , but it was good to place it at the end . peter helped us a lot , that was huge help , please let snic/nsc know :slightly_smiling_face: . yes he did , very helpful guy . i\\u2019ll make sure to highlight that . i will discuss this with my wife and then fill the form . i agree that we really need to plan this more in advance . yes we need to plan long term and realistically - no super pressure to do it now now , but would be good to know before the year is over . added coderefinery workshop to csc events calendar . <https://www . csc . fi/web/training/-/coderefinery-workshop-in-espoo-2017> . thank you ! sorry for leaving early , had to perform the ukevakt duty for our hpc infrastructure . <@u0kv7fvnv> will know all about it 5his week . yeah :slightly_smiling_face: not looking forward to that to be honest . i guess you will get some help , the difficulty is i do not have a full knowledge of everything needed , . e . g adding users to certain groups , not sure the user is allowed to be in it . exactly , i have zero knowledge about that , to be honest i also don\\'t want or need any knowledge about that , completely orthogonal to my expertise and my career goals and i have communicated this to my bosses but this week i have to bite the bullet . occupational hazard . i guess so , i am extremely frustrated about that . added my self to git intro or collaborative git all except february . i could also take stab at something else if any one really want the git . i will also arrange a r section from oslo , from march . great ! will ask our marketing team to market stuff in our social media channels . no newsletters going out in time (next one goes out dec 12th) . i\\'m sure richard is good for that . git intro , link\\xf6ping released done . thanks ! we need to update this: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/> . but it\\'s one of these undocumented things that i need to either do or document . i wonder whether we really need that page and perhaps we can go lightweight only with tags/releases . nobody complained that the page was out of date ... i have a question to you regarding how you organise your course webpages since we are right now in the process of reorganizing this in nbis . this question turned out to be rather long , so i respond to this message with the main question . all our courses are using github pages . previously we have organized all our courses under the scilifelab umbrella and they had one repository for all courses , including old instances of the same course . to create a new course under this scheme one would have to copy the directory for the old course into a new directory and then start editing that . as the number of courses has increased this has gotten a bit unwieldy with a huge clone required to set it up and also risks the entire course page if one person makes one misstake . we have been thinking of having each course as their own git repo (probably under a new github organisation) and then by using submodules in the main repo link in those pages to the main page (that way we can also refer to old instances of the course by just pointing a submodule at a specific branch/commit) . preferably this way ppl can experiment in their own repo without breaking everything and also every course-repo can be kept smaller . the only issue here really is binary files (pdfs , example data , and so forth) . if we don\\u2019t clean up courses after a while each course repo will tend to become large and difficult to work with for that reason . i guess i can rewrite the entire history of the repo to remove those things , but then everyones clones will break so that\\u2019s not so nice (might be the best option though) . another solution is to store these files somewhere else (i don\\u2019t know where) . or maybe even try `git lfs` . our main constraint is that it should not require too much git knowledge to do this (otherwise i will have to do everything) . i saw you were using something you called the `museum` for old courses . how does that work and what happens to the \\u201coriginal\\u201d repo afterwards . i am interested in all comments and experiences you have had . (edited) . i did not know about this , sorry . do we need this ? where is this linked from . not sure :slightly_smiling_face: . i am just thinking: if i am the participant , do i prefer to see the precise material which i have seen which might be wrong (in my case now) or rather an updated material (in my case yes) . we do separate repo for separate lesson and use submodules to not duplicate too much code . the museum is there because github pages sadly only shows one branch per repo , otherwise we could tag them and serve past versions . if large binaries in the history is a problem , then rewrite history - is this really a problem ? are there any forks with active development ? registrations now slowly rolling in , thanks ! can you give a link to the registrations ? there will be a customer training newsletter going out at the end of the month and we can advertise in that if there are slots available . if there aren\\'t there\\'s no point in telling people something they can\\'t do . <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/gu9etd/lrmy2cu7m4fxnyef> . as long as people just start from a fresh clone it\\u2019s not a problem . i just want to make sure it is as effortless for people as possible . yes , difficult call . nice pattern with the submodule for `jekyll-common` . there is no better design pattern than laziness and time pressure :slightly_smiling_face: . well actually that is wrong , often time pressure produces horrible design . anyway , thanks ! well hello ! 17 registrations - looks like we have quite some following from aalto this time . what is a comfortable limit for that room again ? we basically filled up within 2 days , amazing . i\\'ll go count the seats . brb . 24 with some seats on the side for extra teachers and csc people who come to hang . but 24 \"computer\" seats . ok thank you ! if you want double count your (and our) time the classroom without computers next door only has one booking for those 3 days . it\\'s conceivable that we could take in a smaller group of people with laptops there if you want to split the training group in two . of course that\\'s double the effort for people giving each part but otoh it can be almost double the impact . i think that\\'s a good idea but running two tracks is i think tough to do but i got already requests to run another workshop at aalto and also apparently it\\'s exam week so many aalto master students won\\'t be able to attend but would like to eventually . if they\\'re master\\'s students then you can just tell them there\\'s no ects and they will disappear like dust in the wind . source: i was one once . :slightly_smiling_face: . they should be directed to git hub , then they can decide whether to use a release or latest . imo . hard links bad as we already have the versioning best practice in place . the only problem with that it the requires steps on their side: clone , switch to tag , install jekyll , run jekyll; we can do it for them with the museum page but then we need to maintain it , i just wonder whether this is worth doing . let me find out what is a \"museum page\" . is it possible to have pdf just as gz tar . gz in releases ? this is the page: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/> , this is how it is generated: <https://github . com/coderefinery/museum/blob/gh-pages/freezer . sh> . pdf: difficult . tar . gz: we have that already but limited use: you need to install and run jekyll locally , but perhaps that is good enough . ack . workshop is now full , i will confirm people tonight . i am thinking it would be good if we could have a day where we discuss teaching and material perhaps before or after some workshop but i feel we don\\'t have the time ? i have suggestions for others on what to change/improve and i am sure you have suggestions for improvement for my teaching . but i am unsure when to discuss this . not on this side of new years eve:slightly_smiling_face: . 3 day workshop can mean 5 day travel and i don\\'t know where to squeeze the extra day . i agree . sorry for not hitting the thread . no prob . what if we drop a few workshops ? we will probably have to (we will evaluate , see other thread) . sure we have committed to a lot , but we are actual overcommitted . yes we are definitely overcommitted , i don\\'t think it is a good idea to power through the schedule . i am following a \\u201cwild\\u201d idea . since there is three campuses at , i will discuss with the media centre whether it is possible to broadcast the lessons given in trondheim to the other campuses (gjoevik and aalesund) . this is distance learning , but at the same time we could probably produce a recording . if the ones giving the lessons are willing , we could publish it . this will probably incur some cost , but we will be better suited to drop some ws (save cost) . i think this is interesting to follow up , but i also think that giving a workshop to real people in the room and to a camera audience are two different things; what i think we need long term to reach scale is fewer workshops combined with screencasts highlighting one particular thing which people can watch at their convenience . will see how this turn out - might not be available infrastructure for doing this , but i have asked . i am thinking: if i was a participant , would i like to watch 3 days of video where the speaker is not in the camera field 50% of the time or would i rather watch 15 minute long screencasts which have been produced for me . .. you\\u2019ll be amazed by what people watch . of course , we will need to lower our standards when doing anything like this . it\\'s probably useful , i would personally probably not watch it and rather go for screencasts but i am aware that people need and prefer different things . at last espoo workshop somebody was recording audio so i guess there is a need for audio/video . what i think could be good is if we replace one workshop with one material preparation/discussion workshop . that\\u2019s an interesting idea . let\\u2019s do that . hmm , what happened with the espoo workshop , 32 registrations !? yep , dissemination channels for sure worked , i will confirm first 24 , place rest on waiting list , and close registration tonight . ok . alternately we can look for a larger space . i mean the building does have a large-ish conference room but that\\'s not exclusively for csc . shall i still ask my wife to make a workshop poster ? it\\u2019s easy of course , just edititing the details . i think the poster would be good , to spread the word and also put it up while we are there . two requests w . r . t . travel expenses: 1) please make sure your institution invoices neic for all your 2017 travels before 2017 is over and 2) i will have to track your travel expenses in 2018; nothing bad happened that requires this only except that i am not able to say how much travel money we have exactly spent and i have learned that i need to be able to provide that information . ack . ok . got it . i also think we can discontinue the museum . the lessons are getting more and more converged and it\\u2019s overkill to make these mildly different versions available . btw i also tagged the git-collab , jupyter and documentation lessons for the link\\xf6ping workshop . ok i will nuke the museum; the lessons are still reproducible if we tag them , i think newer is better even if it has changed a bit . aha this is where we reference them: . _workshops/2016-12-14-espoo . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/espoo-dec2016/git-intro/> _workshops/2016-12-14-espoo . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/espoo-dec2016/documentation/> _workshops/2016-12-14-espoo . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/espoo-dec2016/git-collaborative/> _workshops/2016-12-14-espoo . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/espoo-dec2016/testing/> _workshops/2016-12-14-espoo . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/espoo-dec2016/automation/> _workshops/2016-12-14-espoo . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/espoo-dec2016/cmake/> _workshops/2016-12-14-espoo . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/espoo-dec2016/ides/> _workshops/2017-02-20-stockholm . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/stockholm-feb2017/git-intro/> _workshops/2017-02-20-stockholm . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/stockholm-feb2017/devops/> _workshops/2017-02-20-stockholm . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/stockholm-feb2017/git-collaborative/> _workshops/2017-02-20-stockholm . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/stockholm-feb2017/testing/> _workshops/2017-02-20-stockholm . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/stockholm-feb2017/cmake/> _workshops/2017-02-20-stockholm . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/stockholm-feb2017/ides/> _workshops/2017-02-20-stockholm . md: url: <https://coderefinery . github . io/museum/stockholm-feb2017/documentation/> . but the question is if it should be nuked or just not updated anymore . that\\u2019s what i meant with the material converging , it isn\\u2019t changing as much as it did early on . i guess it is a good feature but i admit it is a pain for me to take care of this . but we want to modify the material also in future , do we want the material to reflect precisely what people have seen ? if yes , then we better continue . i did not react to the larger space: i think beyond 30 people it is hard to manage and still remain hands-on . no let\\u2019s just remove it . i find it very unlikely that people will absolutely want the same material they saw . people move on and start learning on their own . ok , i will let the pages point to the latest material , i also think this is globally better; we can always go back since we don\\'t remove history . linkoeping workshop feedback finally typed up , compulsory reading for everybody who teaches . <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1xhmzvuogtzpbyjeljc3kurel6l-rq4ak5hu8qps3ne0/> . thank you for the effort taken to y type this , very constructive comments . most of it is typed up by thor so i don\\'t want to take false credit :slightly_smiling_face: there were few remaining postits in my bag traveling for few days . indeed the comments are very useful , totally clear to me what i need to improve in my lessons . espoo workshop demand is huge , we have the option to move to this room <https://booking . aalto . fi/kokvar/tilakuvat/u7_sali . jpg> or even larger rooms if we wish to . what do you think ? i won\\u2019t be coming , but maybe it would be interesting to try a bigger format . however , that would probably require all 5 instructors to be quite active as helpers . richard (contact from aalto) said that he could recruit an army of helpers . independent of that we need to become more active as helpers in general . i vote for including all that have signed up . 32 sofar was it ? <@u21ph491q> there\\'s no easier place to have 5 instructors than in espoo . (or cheaper for that matter) . there is also this: <https://booking . aalto . fi/kokvar/tilakuvat/u9 . jpg> . by cheaper you mean room reservation wise ? (iiuc it is just across the street) . cheaper personnel travel cost wise . as there are lots of project personnel based there and that is so close they won\\'t even need a bus ticket . i am now confused: is espoo then cheaper than aalto or the other way round ? ahh , miscommunication . of all the cities in the nordics where we have workshops (aalto is in espoo) this is the cheapest because we have so many project personnel located here . in fact aalto has a side campus in the center of helsinki that would be even better but i\\'m not sure if richard can book a room there . i agree that being close to espoo saves money but is there any significant difference between e and a ? i mean the same thing with both words . ok good :slightly_smiling_face: . there\\'s a university in helsinki and there\\'sa university in espoo , which is called aalto even though i campaigned for \"university of espoo\" . i think the two rooms advertised in this thread would be on the campus across the bus stop; they are miraculously still available but i need to tell richard soon , i think 30-ish people is doable and although we could get even larger rooms , i don\\'t want to go much beyond 30 . at least the second one is . i think i took freshman physics in that room back when it was a lecture hall . and the first one looks like it is based on architecture but i can\\'t place it . the first one look like a parliament where we could have heated discussions about git vs svn . the second one looks indeed not bad , hoping that also screens are good (they are excellent in current csc room) . and if aalto has an exam period then it\\'s logical that those rooms are free because they are not the best for sitting exams . i think that is exactly the case . i am checking with richard about projector sitaution . 2 projectors , a bit smallish but seems doable - objections to moving to the bigger room ? i am being constantly asked questions like how many people have participated in workshops ? where do they come from ? which disciplines ? any use cases ? etc . we need to put statistics on the web . i really want to use the website to defend myself against such questions . we have the pre and post survey data . is anybody interested in crunching some stats and putting graphics on the web ? i was thinking of showing a distribution of disciplines , a map that shows which workshops attracted people from where , and the post-workshop survey data . it\\'s also interesting in itself as pr , not just to deflect questions . ideally it would be great if we use some js magic to separate data from graphics and where graphics are rendered on the fly so that we can update data later without going through the whole thing again . alternative: jupyter notebook , for the same reason as above . hey , does prace say anything to you ? a little bit , not much . why ? because it does . partnership for advanced computing in europe - the hpc-group@ntnu have participated in prace application enabling since 2009 . so there is some knowledge of prace in coderefinery . i interpret that as no objections; i will go for it . ok we have moved to aalto , we can comfortably accommodate 45-50 :slightly_smiling_face: i will update website , inform confirmed participants about the change , bump waiting list people up , possibly reopen registration ? we have moved the dec workshop to aalto , can somebody within csc please release reservation on dogmi ? <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-12-12-espoo/> . welcome richard and thanks for the help with the room reservation ! greetings , thanks . going to make the next announcement now . if someone wants to come for just one session (cmake) , what should i say ? can we say , just drop in and see if there is room , there may not be a table space ? room also appears to have recording equipment , but not sure if it is usable . say: drop by , especially for the cmake :slightly_smiling_face: . i agree , fine to drop by in this case . yes . for those who will teach in espoo/aalto: we have some \"tba\" slots . <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-12-12-espoo/> . we need some clarity on who takes these . most urgently we need somebody covering the jupyter notebooks , but also collaborative git , and documentation; i can buffer it out but i don\\'t want to monopolize too much . i could do any , maybe prefer jupyter &gt; git &gt;&gt; docs . richard , you are going through irc gate right ? i don\\'t want to force you into other tools (slack client or web interface) but we try to use threading and i can imagine that you cannot see any threads on your end . the motivation for the threads is to make it easier for people with different interests to skip messages/discussions and group discussions together . ah , ok . can do . ok , here . thanks for the tip . cool :slightly_smiling_face: sorry for forcing you out of the irc . are jupyter notebooks fun for you ? if yes and if you would like to cover that session , that would of course be fantastic , the session is well converged and working well but of course you would have the opportunity to suggest changes . i think they would be , it\\'s something i want people to use more and started supporting on our cluster . i\\'ve used just enough it\\'s still interesting to do more of . ok have a look at the session and let us know what you think about it and if it sounds like a fun challenge to you then i would be very happy of course . but i see it\\'s on the first day . i had wanted to see some other lectures first , assuming that you have learned good strategies for teaching these things . you can also first check how the workshop goes and contribute as instructor next time , no pressure . dear team members , you have the possibility to influence the follow-up coderefinery project 2019 and onwards . please edit/suggest on <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1j2_wxgjkiih6gohjoknzqglrgnikqhu8c9ojczklpys/> . thanks for all those who have commented/edited so far . i plan to submit this to the steering group next week for their attention so that they can brainstorm about it before steering group meeting dec 5 . i\\'ve done teaching like this before , mainly i would like some ideas about ideas you\\'ve gotten from software carpentry and the like . which is what i tihnk we are missing . i am absolutely sure that you can do this well but i understand that it makes sense to first see how we do it , we don\\'t get everything right but we have a functioning setup i believe , inspired by the carpentries and also optimized with the help of feedback; executive summary: less is more , exercises are better than talking , the more hands on the better , many questions and discussions , minimize cognitive load (demonstrate new concept with a simple example , do not require people to learn two new things in one go) . let\\'s run first with our regular team (we will manage to distribute the schedule) and then next time you can be involved in teaching which will be win win , really looking forward . ok we have 45 registrations for espoo/aalto; this will be quite something ! i had to close registration again , overwhelming run on the seats . <http://ohshitgit . com/> . good stuff ! other good resources: <https://github . com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules> . <https://www . gitignore . io> . <@u0kv7fvnv> thanx , i was looking trough to have a some sort of \"git game\" \"git fun stuff\" sort of thing (not sure exactly what i want) .... more less a light-hearted look at possible mistakes and how to get ourt . purposefully create a difficult situation and students must find the best way to get out of it . <https://learngitbranching . js . org/> . can sign up for the jupyter notebooks . thanks bj\\xf8rn ! meeting today 12 cet , 13 eet , agenda (please edit and add new points): <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1mvb1fqge2aaz-4xowvgdmqp2xlbjrlmo50ms8xqjo8e/> . i am unavailable at 12 . could be that i connect around 12:30 , but i am a bit uncertain . ok no problem , please write your views/suggestions on the agenda points so that we know your opinion when discussing things . sorry , i will not be abel to get back on time , i will join by 12:30 . i\\'ll be in in about 5 minutes . i made some initial material on reproducibility research . please check and let me know if something needs to be addressed . if you have a good example for hands-on please inform . <https://coderefinery . github . io/reproducible-research/> . <https://github . com/coderefinery/reproducible-research> . do we have some info about github gists <https://gist . github . com/> . in our workshop material . we haven\\'t mentioned these , it\\'s a really nice service . very very sorry , this completely fell off my radar . i\\'ll catch up with the meeting minutes . i\\u2019ll go through the project directive this evening . any objections or comments ? i\\u2019ll upload the notebook to our drive in a bit . no objection . thanks , no problem . good idea , i would really like to have that data accessible from website . a first draft of the article is under coderefinery(outreach , filename coderefinery-pdcnewsletter-winter2017 (<https://docs . google . com/document/d/1vvnanwq6lbm7jwutmyorclp8mevlkqgwzgvkumjh1_q/edit#heading=h . 4kjzbg67zng>) . how did you create it ? the plot ? from data from the post-workshop survey results . but how ? the graph shows the statistics on how people answered the question \\u201chow has your usage of x changed since the workshop\\u201d . i did the analysis in jupyter , will clean it up a bit and upload . its a seaborn . heatmap . great ! because i think we should publish the jupyter notebook (meaning put it out on github) and link this from the website (see also discussion some time ago in the channel) - i think this is a fantastic solution to publish both the graph , the data , using tools we believe in and that make sense . done ! new repository in <https://github . com/coderefinery/post-workshop-survey> . brilliant ! it\\u2019s briefly mentioned in connection with a jupyter magic command , but it would be good to mention it also in git parts . sorry for late attention to this . i had a few things in mind to contribute (training coordinator etc) but they\\u2019re already concisely mentioned in the draft . maybe just one thing , which i can write a sentence about: emphasize importance of building bridges with experts at snic , deic , csc and sigma2 . these organizations can contribute teachers , and coderefinery can contribute train-the-trainer workshops . ok im done . the draft looks very good . looks very interesting ! i\\u2019d love to contribute , i\\u2019ll allocate time over the next days . + . thanks ! i will send it out tonight . about catering for the espoo workshop <@u82u00n6s> (thread) . normally we try to provide coffee/tea/water plus possibly some small snacks (fruit/croissants in the morning , cake in the afternoon) . or simply coffee and cookies . is this something that we can organize at aalto ? we are not asking for lunch , \"only\" for coffee and afternoon breaks a little something . but to be honest , for 45+ people this is not little money either . do we have space for 45 ? yes , there is apparently space to fit 45 comfortably , we could squeeze in even more but that becomes hard to manage then . there are cafes and restaurants in the building , and they should be able to do catering for us easily for the right price . cafe is just one floor down , so we can also just say \"here\\'s a break , go buy something from downstairs\" . asked about catering . basic cost is 3 . 10\\u20ac/person for coffee(+stuff i guess) , 3 . 60\\u20ac/p cake , 2 . 40( ? ) for salty snacks . but i should email to discuss better prices/better service . what are we willing to pay/what do we want ? also , how many participants are from aalto ? maybe i can ask for science-it funding , too . i think we can also bring our own small snacks . also sink with running water in the room . details on room facilities: . well , can\\'t post pictures to threads , so here: <https://users . aalto . fi/~darstr1/coderefinery/> . 60-70% are from aalto , we can spend 200 eur on catering but it can get complicated invoice-wise (for one workshop i had to pay 400 eur catering out of own pocket which i am not anymore ready to do) , what we did once was buy fruit in the supermarket and \"borrow\" coffee from a friendly office nearby , if we can do something which is light on the wallet and light on reimbursement paper battle , then i prefer that . 61 chairs , 14 soft stools , 12 power outlets per row . thanks ! it seems the pics are not possible to view from outside your network . but i am happy about the number stats :slightly_smiling_face: . photo permissions fixed now . self-catering is always an option here , too . room looks perfect , thank you for reserving this ! very nice . what\\'s the normal catering cost/person at other workshops (and how many people) ? i think there\\'s a fair chance of some reasonable funding from aalto . but even at 3/person , it turns into a *lot* . yeah it\\'s a lot of money . <@u82u00n6s> coffee and pastries is surprisingly epensive . fruit and cookies/pastries from the store are relatively cheap and actually convenient what with the subway and all . how about we buy pastries/cookies/fruit and aalto sponsors a can of coffee and tea ? they get a workshop \"for free\" . <@u0kv7fvnv> , yeah , that is what i think is fair . i\\'ll propose to people when i see them . (though there is even internal rent , we are internally paying 600+\\u20ac for this room too) . --&gt; meeting . aha ok , then let\\'s not overstretch , i appreciate the room booking , if a coffee is possible without too much trouble , then we go for it but it is also fine if people buy their own coffees . do we want something both morning and afternoon ? typically we have two breaks , one 10:30 and one 15:00 . also , thinking of lunch times: it may be worth planning to make sure our lunch isn\\'t the student rush . 12:00 can be a peak time , but i\\'m not sure about exam weeks . yes , let us displace the schedule to avoid peak; normally 12-13 is lunch but we can move +/- 30 mins to avoid traffic jam . software installation on aalto laptops: aalto laptops are managed with limited admin access , so we should make sure there are good installation instructions . i\\'ve checked instructions and most is easy , at least linux/osx . thanks ! that is good to know , thanks for checking that . there are some special instructions , which i can write in our docs and the you can link to . (like , how to get admin rights to do it - a common question) . is this the best way ? <@u0kv7fvnv> <@u2k0egsc8> i asked seija , our resident r guru about giving the jupyter session and she was initially assented . no problem . seija can do it . it will be fine to get a r perspective . first offers of catering prices from the building\\'s place: coffee , tea(2kkp)dose 2 , 50 \\u20ac (disposable 2 , 35 \\u20ac) coffee , tea , bread roll day 5 , 25 \\u20ac fruit blocks , dose 2 , 65 \\u20ac . coffee , tea , bun 4 , 60 \\u20ac coffee , tea , biscuits 3 , 10 . so 6 breaks coffee/tea only=750\\u20ac . sounds good to me if it is fine for bjoern , want to avoid that he invested time which might not be used but if that is not the case , then that\\'s a good idea to get r competence in . can you please update the schedule ? thanks richard ! i have to think about that ... science-it will fund up to 1k\\u20ac , so we should be good . awesome ! thank you . my suggestion is to not \"hardcode\" the order for the entire 3 days . what i have done in the past is to order day by day and see how it goes , sometimes people want less coffee , more tea , etc . and order day by day , one day in advance but i don\\'t know how flexible the system is and also it might be too much hassle for you which i want to avoid . also it will probably happen that a couple of people don\\'t show up on day 2 or 3 but we had a good record in the past . initial offer said they wanted to know by 7 . 12 , so it may not be easy to go day-by-day . i think usually they provide a good balance of coffee/tea , and we can probably request more or less of one or the other . the hassle is not that much , but certainly just paying a lot saves time . for the 200e that coderefinery has , what\\'s the easiest way to do that ? e . g . if you just go to the store and buy the snacks , is that convenient ? i can also do it and get reimbursed . thanks richard , if you can set us up with coffee , that is already great - i can worry about the pastries and fruit . i uploaded a workshop poster for the espoo workshop on drive under outreach (filenames espooposter_printing_shabbir . png and espooposter_printing_shabbir . pdf) . no more advertisement is needed of course but it might be nice to hang them around campus for pr . thanks ! i think this is a very good idea . <@u0kv7fvnv> <http://source . coderefinery . org|source . coderefinery . org> updated to the latest version before a major version upgrade (9 . x-&gt;10 . x) . will update to 10 . x once people report those are stable . thank you so much ! can you please remove the maintenance banner ? it should have been timed so it will expire in 30 minutes . but i\\'ll just make it expire 30 minutes ago instead . righto , it was utc and not eet . ok if it autoexpires it is fine to leave it until it does . thank you for the work ! for continuity purposes <@u5l3ena15> will handle the upgrade to 10 . x , probably in december . <@u2b3dh142> can you add me to the reproducible-research repo ? i don\\u2019t have write access . (and i just made a pr via a fork) . added the team to the repo . ok - thank you . the migration of the service to deic is not forgotten but paperwork takes very long time , sorry for that . <@u23htrtjt> , the espoo schedule shows me as instructor on the jupyter notebooks , but it is seija , right ? right , not updated . so what\\'s the procedure for updating pages ? a pr ? in doubt , pr; if you are certain and pressed on time , direct push . :+1: . <@u2234ay5a> , about the ide-session , what if we divide the session in three parts ? - introduction , code developement , \\u201carcheology\\u201d ? for each part we go in quite som detail . the introduction can be about \\u201call that meets the eye\\u201d - the interface and how to configure it . development could be about the coding: refactoring , templates , available documentation , the resources you have at hand when you write code . \\u201carcheology\\u201d could be git integration , debugging . how to get familiar with a code . all done in pycharm as previously . i don\\'t want to talk you into this but i recommend to define goals for this session . imo (but this is only my opinion) the goal should not be to teach how to use pycharm . imo what it should rather be is to demonstrate the strengths of an ide with pycharm taken only as a popular example . please mind that we will have people who have never written a single python line . feel free to not follow my recommendations but my recommendation is to keep python examples as simple as possible , already the __name__ == \\'__main__\\' will be unfamiliar to at least 25% of people . imo there is no point teaching pycharm shortcuts unless the goal is to teach pycharm which may be fine , you just need to be clear about what you want to achieve . but i do like the division you have suggested . of course it may be totally fine to use shortcuts during the demo/hands-on if we communicate clearly that the point is not to remember them . the last few times we had trouble with font sizes and visibility , this is something we have to fix; if people cannot even see what we type there , they have no other choice than disconnect and all is lost because of a detail . question related to coderefinery\\'s gitlab: are there plans to add jenkins plugin or other ways to set up autodeployment ? can you please describe briefly what the jenkins part that you would like to interface to does or will accomplish ? or briefly describe the autodeployment part ? imo , the goal \\u201cto demonstrate ides\\u201d is to vague . you don\\u2019t get the feel of pycharms strengths , nor do you experience what you see/learn is the general strength of an ide . i think we should teach pycharm , with hands-on type and demos . in that way the student get exposed to one ide with the strengths that we \\u201cclaim\\u201d ides have . fair enough but i think it is 1) very hard or impossible to teach a new tool in 1 . 5 hours , 2) this tool will most likely be irrelevant to 25-33% of the audience just because it starts with \"py\"; but the same can be argued against cmake session so again: fair enough . speaking of which: i am aware that it is also impossible to teach cmake in 3 h and this is not my goal - also there my goal is to give a taste and motivate people to explore on their own . i don\\u2019t think we will deliver a silver bullet this time either , but if we are able to go deeper or into more detail in some respects , we might have a new experience - something to iterate on . good :slightly_smiling_face: . i think what i am asking is: why jenkins ? probably short meeting today 12 cet , 13 eet - agenda (please edit): <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1wtopb9utmi1yrdn2gdl0c_mjb--kmkvhz0qgg5shiqk/> . i am unavailable this monday , as well . have a private appointment . they say we can adjust the number of people and amount of coffee/tea balance the day before , but not day of . and actually , i can get the other snacks . it\\'s easy for me and <@u0kv7fvnv> will be busy enough with the other things . thanks richard ! day before is perfectly fine and we are a couple of people so we can load-level the snacks but thank you ! coderefinery is mentioned in this presentation <https://zenodo . org/record/997904# . whvgvbazpax> . hi: why jenkins: since we have a person which has set up continous integration , auto deployment and functional testing (with nagios probes) through jenkins for us . so we would like to integrate this into gitlab instead of having it running as a separate remote service . what are the other options ? here is link to his setup: <http://autodeploy . grid . upjs . sk:8080/> . and the funtional tests: <https://arc-emi . grid . upjs . sk/nagios> . last link accessible through arcuser name for both fields . i\\'m working to confirm the catering now . if any other suggestions , let me know now . so imo jenkins is a fine tool but gitlab ci can do it possibly simpler ? but there seems to be a plugin so it could be possible to integrate the two: <https://wiki . jenkins . io/display/jenkins/gitlab+plugin> . yes , i have read there are plugins , so would be great if we can apply what has been done for us inside gitlab . however , for gitlab ci- i do not see any \\u201cautodeploy\\u201d button . is this because this functionality has not yet been turned on ? what is an autodeploy and where do you find it mentioned ? is it this that you wish to do: <https://docs . gitlab . com/ee/ci/autodeploy/index . html> ? yes , this is what i was thinking of . i am thinking that it can be used to deploy the software on a test-machine to run it , in order to run tests on it . i was just asking , since i was wondering what is the best way to reuse the work done in jenkins . either use a plugin , or \\u201cmigrate\\u201d the work using the autodeploy setup . but then i saw that this was not activated on the coderefinery gitlab . so what you want to run is a set of tests for each commit and report back ? if yes , how many commits do you expect per day ? how much time do you expect the tests to run on a typical single-core ? so by autodeploying you mean running tests or does it involve more ? so what we ultimately need is the following: 1) run ci build on three branches after each commit . 2) for releases: deploy (install) the software on a test-machine , and run a series of tests on it . which basically means setting up an arc compute-element and submitting a test grid job to it . 3) for releases: produce rpms for a set of supported platforms . this is all done in jenkins now , except we only have rpms for one platform , and ci only on trunk . 1) i think the ci build should be run only on the branches that receive a commit , no need to rerun a branch if it did not receive the commit . 2) ok , the test machine should be a docker container or a \"real\" machine ? about time for each test , will have to get back to that . 1) yes , that is what i meant . time for each test: just ballpark number: seconds , minutes , hours ? 2) yes . well , the tests in them selves i think are very fast . probably seconds/minutes . so the whole testset is less than an hour roughly ? and how often do we expect to run this per day ? very roughly . less than an hour: i will expect so yes . we only need these tests really related to releases . if it is \\u201ccheap\\u201d we can consider running tests also once per day for instance on the master branch . i think you should test each commit , not only release commits because then you capture errors earlier , 1h per day is no problem . ok , very good . you wrote that tests themselves are fast , is there some component that is not fast ? unless you have many commits a day ? how many commits per day do you expect ? (roughly) . well , setting up the machine might not be \\u201cso\\u201d fast . with ansible scripts i know it takes roughly 30 minutes . but that might be fast in your scale . the functional tests are fast . not sure about the other tests , there are analysis of the code and such that i do not know so much about . commits a day: on a good day: 10 . sometimes 1 . when release is coming up , obviously more . to me it sounds like gitlab ci can do all that; colleagues please correct me . we are almost ready to offer two compute nodes for this and this could be a nice pilot project to debug our infrastructure services and your code at the same time . you could use it to gradually get rid of jenkins , which is fine and powerful but one more thing to maintain by someone . sounds nice . however: since a lot of work has been done for us with jenkins , i think we could try to utilize this in some way . i am not sure how much the two different approaches share in common . would be very nice to connect you to marek which has done the setup for us . so we can discuss the best way to reuse the work . ok , i need to go to my gate for boarding now . so will be offline some hours . thanks a lot for you time ! i understand that the jenkins cannot or should not be thrown away immediately but i think gitlab ci would be potentially easier/better for you long term but we can take that in steps . <@u0kv7fvnv> i got a lead on university of helsinki possibly being interested in their own coderefinery . possibly so that the uni would pay for it . not super likely , but certainly worth following up on . nice ! thank you ! apparently the postgrad student organ was asked to suggest courses . hmm !!! brand awareness ! well , more like i advertised that such a thing exists and i was asked if we could also give it at uh . sounds like a plan ! :slightly_smiling_face: . very long but good read: <https://www . theatlantic . com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/> . <@u0kv7fvnv>:oslo june 2018 , what are preferred dates /weekday/room size . i need to book the rooms for next year as it is first come first serve and there is a high completion for rooms . mid-june , 12-14 june would be my preference . that is tue to thursday , does any one prefer a weekend at one end ? that week is still fine for me . tue-thu is good since it keeps traveling away from weekend . but in oslo i don\\'t care since traveling is easy for me so whatever fits people best . room: <http://coderefinery . org/workshop-requirements/> . my preference is just a wish , but getting to oslo at 09 a monday morning is kind of challenging , even in summer . yeah , let\\'s keep tue-thu . ack . current aalto managed laptop installation instructions: <http://scicomp . aalto . fi/news/coderefinery . html> . are the software installation instructions currently linking to what is needed , or more/less ? you mean these: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-12-12-espoo/> ? they are more or less converged , we send out the info to participants one week ahead of course . i will include yours and also link to them on the page . thank you ! yes , those instructions . mainly i\\'m wondering if all of the python packages are needed for this workshop , if not for linux people we can possibly just have them use packages from ubuntu 16 . 04 repos . though , we probably should recommend anaconda anyway because jupyter is missing . also numba , and other versions may be too old . page may still need updating , but i can have it done by one week before . we will probably need all but they are part of anaconda , those who don\\'t like anaconda should probably go for virtualenv . <https://sec . eff . org/articles/touching-devices> . so true , also a common sin of mine . especially in an environment where there are many people i need to help and a limited amount of me per unit of time . same here , it\\'s easier and simper and faster but we should try to resist the instinct to just type it out for them . if jupyter notebooks are done with r , should that be included in installation instructions ? <@u23htrtjt> help :slightly_smiling_face: i don\\'t know how the jupyter notebooks will be done . jyry can you please check with the instructor whether our install instructions are missing something for the jupyter session ? i\\'ll ask . i\\'ll also ask if we couldn\\'t do most of the things in a notebooks-environment to avoid needing to install *everything* (which is basically what is needed for all the bells and whistles in the jupyter session) . i know you have a philosophy of also leaving people with working tool setups on their own machine , but the cost-benefit ration in jupyter installs is questionable . we have another request for a workshop (thread) . email i just got: . hi ! my name is daniel kastinen and im a phd student at irf (swedish institute of space physics) in kiruna . i am currently looking into the possibility to arrange a software design course for myself and possibly other phd students here in kiruna . it was when digging around for material and other learning possibilities that i came across your workshops trough one of my co-supervisors who just attended one in link\\xf6ping . these workshops seems perfect for what i want to learn . talking with some other people here at irf there are at lest 10-20 people interested in attending such a workshop . so i was wondering: could you consider coming to irf in kiruna to give such a workshop ? how many people would you want to attend to consider coming here ? if needed i can go around and get a preliminary registration list and see how many we are ! thanks in advance ! best regards , daniel . what is very nice about such requests is that it would remove the need that we advertise and announce since here we already have a group of people and possibly a room and everything; i was imagining that over time we transition more into these and this is now happening . of course does not solve the problem that we have difficulties staffing workshops . we split in three groups , one to uppsala , one to lund and one to kiruna . \\u2026or is one person going , not groups :slightly_smiling_face: ? it is very cool that we get these request , but of course we cannot go everywhere . actually , what about doing that , going one instructor to each site , and do video conferencing across ? getting some instructions from each site , but having one person locally helping out . entire workshop by one person is doable but really tough; what i was thinking is to say yes to those places which have contacted us and perhaps drop some places where we planned to go \"uninvited\" - simply because it simplifies organization and also it is nice to say yes to these requests and it is also nice to not having to actively advertise and fear that we get an empty room . . registered for the :carpentries instructor training , univ . of oslo , dec 4-5 , hoping to become a better teacher . very good ! this is very useful training , very good investment of time . i would love to go to kiruna of course ! but yes , the question is staffing and if it\\u2019s a good idea to drop \\u201cuninvited\\u201d workshops in favor of invited ones . and i think the minimum number of teachers is 3 for a 3-day workshop , since helping out during exercises is crucial . i agree with minimum number 3 . maybe this is a point to bring up next week in the sg meeting ? great ! it\\u2019s useful . <@u0kv7fvnv>: if there a training program that i would like to attend , how do i check whether neic willing to pay for it ? (asking in public as this might be interesting to others) . i mean course fee .. traveling etc .. if it is relevant for your work within coderefinery you talk to your project manager <@u0kv7fvnv> about it and he will decide if it really is relavant and if can be covered from the project budget , otherwise you make an application to our ratatosk travel grant <https://neic . no/training/travel-grant/> . ack . imo if this is relevant for the project , your development within the project , and in a reasonable price range , then i don\\'t see how i can say no . i was testing git installation on aalto linux laptop . there are some new options so you have to click \"next\" more than it says . also you can choose nano instead of vi now . as to jupyter: imo it worked well the last workshops without too much pain but if a cloud solution minimizes the pain , that is all fine for me . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i assume you have seen <http://notebooks . csc . fi|notebooks . csc . fi> ? though it needs login ... yeah , because we talked at neic . it\\'s better now from what i can see . for windows instructions , \"make\" , there is a broken link on <http://gnuwin32 . sourceforge . net|gnuwin32 . sourceforge . net> , so that instructions won\\'t work (instead: go to site top level page directly and click packages on time) . how many people actually use windows in the course ? typically one or two people arrive with windows . if you see issues there and have no time to submit a fix (which i completely understand) , please leave a github issue , otherwise i am guaranteed to forget . also i saw the discussion about pycharm , no mention of that in instructions yet . yes , i can make pr with fixes myself ... basically using this to make sure i\\'m interperting things correctly . because aalto laptops are centrally managed , there are lots of quirks especially on windows . <@u2b3dh142> i\\u2019ve done some more work on the workflow episode , on branch thor-workflow . it\\u2019s not quite ready , and to be honest i think it\\u2019ll be difficult to teach in espoo since one probably needs to get quite comfortable with sumatra before teaching it . or would you like to include it ? in any case , the episode starts with an overview of scientific workflows and available tools . the sumatra type-along exercise is at the end . okay ! i have just made a commit to the original repository (still correcting some typos) . i think we already have enough material . i will see if we can somehow include it to the existing material . once we fix this , we need to announce this and create the page . i need to send out install instructions for espoo workshop tomorrow - everybody who teaches there please reply to this thread . and please confirm here that the instructions contain everything that you will need and nothing more (as far as it is possible to tell) . <@u21ph491q> i have checked the workflow material . looks good but as you mentioned it needs some practice to work with sumatra . in the espoo session , i will just mention that there are multiple tools available to manage workflows (uses what tools are out there part) . i\\'ll confer with seija about the notebooks . <@u0kv7fvnv> just to confirm: i can cancel the booking on the csc teaching room , right ? <@u0kv7fvnv> also i was just told that we have a provisional booking for 20 . -22 . 3 . in turku . can we lock the dates ? <@u2b3dh142> that sounds like a good idea . the sumatra part needs to mature a bit more , and it\\u2019s by far better to start small and then possibly expand the material later . but as radovan mentioned in issue #3 , the make part needs to be coordinated with the cmake session . sure ! thinking about it . right - thanks for taking care of that . thor and sabry have marked interest so they need to confirm; also depends on whether we get local support from there - i am personally a bit exhausted with everything that needs to be done around a workshop apart from the material and teaching which is a lot of work already . thanks ! what kind of local support do you want/need ? ordering coffee ? i have at least some local contacts and people at csc have many more . if you can boil all the preparations to a checklist we can test letting someone other than you worry about all of them . the catering part we need to offload to them , but i also need help with the pre- and post-workshop communication with participants , website , making sure we have the schedule set , registration form , notifying participants , making sure install instructions are sent out (all the latter part we cannot offload but we can load level better) . how many helpers would you like for espoo december ? i have four people so far who can come for various bits (not including me or science-it) . and , are you positive or negative on recording espoo lectures ? one helper offered to help with that too , using some aalto system . thanks richard , 4 extra people is 300% more than we usually have so we should be really good , thank you . yeah , i just figured with such a large workshop , we should have plenty of backup people . some of them i also want to train to teach better too , so it\\'s useful no matter if they are needed . i am personally skeptical about the usefulness of such videos since the lectures are not geared towards videos (for this imo it is better to record screencasts or dedicated webinars) but i am not opposed to being recorded if somebody else finds these videos useful . but others need to give their opinion , too . imo it matters whether i am talking to people or talking to a camera , the content is different for optimum result (imo) . this is different for lectures which go 30 mins where videos are great but 3 day recording of hands-on typing with explanations in-between ? i don\\'t know ... but i don\\'t want to rule this out - i know that others (e . g . bjoern) see it differently than me . i fully agree that if we do only a smallish subset might be useful after the fact . i think the equipment is all there already , and someone is interested , so i would say: \"we can try but it\\'s an experiment , it may not be suitable and no special effort to do it\" . checked . we\\'ll do things a bit differently with the time constraints and work using notebooks . no installation required . personally i think that recording lectures is mostly the equivalent of making new year\\'s promises you don\\'t intend to keep . i mean sure , if it\\'s richard feynman teaching physics 101 then i\\'m all for it but none of us is richard feynman (no offence guys) . i agree with jyry - it takes a lot of preparing and/or being r . f . to do the video recording well; this does not mean that we do the live sessions not well but it\\'s two different things - again i don\\'t want to discourage initiatives but i don . + \\'t think we are there yet to deliver a session that works well over video . thanks , to reconfirm: no jupyter or r installation needed from participants ? <@u2234ay5a> <@u2k0egsc8> <@u2b3dh142> how about your modules ? <@u2b3dh142> <@u21ph491q> <http://www . britishecologicalsociety . org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code . pdf> . great material , thanks ! i am available . ? is this a reply to the right thread ? appologize for being unresponsive , and undecided with respect to installing pycharm . i concluded this probably should be optional . booked a super room for june 12 , 13 , 14 in oslo . <@u21ph491q> <@u2k0z6mdg> do you have any objections to the dates ? <@u0kv7fvnv> *we* cannot offload but surely *you* can :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u23htrtjt> no i don\\u2019t object to the dates . no objections . awesome ! thanks ! ok - i have to send it out today , i will try to make clear in the docs that pycharm is optional . can you please mark it on the website ? <@u23htrtjt> if turku is scheduled , same goes for that workshop . a have a question regarding jekyll generated pages - using the copy of ahm17 for ahm18 . i have a _crossteams folder , with several files 01-session . md 02-session . md etc . i have added the folder in my _config . yml file in collections , so i do actually (in earlier attempt) manage to loop through the contents of hte folder and present the content of each file . however , i now try: . &lt;ul&gt; {% for crossteam in site . crossteams %} &lt; ! -- hack to not print the subpages here --&gt; {% if crossteam . name == \\u201cdetails\\u201d %} &lt; ! -- do nothing --&gt; {% else %} {% if crossteam . ho_details %} &lt;li&gt;{{ crossteam . ho_organizers }}: &lt;a href=\\u201c{{ site . baseurl }}/{{ crossteam . ho_details }}\\u201c&gt;{{crossteam . ho_title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; {% endif %} {% endif %} {% endfor %} &lt;/ul&gt; in the _includes/crossteams . html file . and i clearly do not understand how things work properly , the if-tests do not kick in , and variables are empty . so the if-test on crossteam . ho_details does not kick in , although the 01-session . md has this content: --- ho_organizers:tdb ho_title: \\u201chow do we use tools for version control and co-editing e . g . google drive , wiki , github ? \\u201d ho_details: /crossteams/hodetails1/ . what i recommend to do (but you have probably done that): insert some prints to make sure you loop over the right data: what happens when you echo {{ crossteam ]] and {{ crossteam . name }} ? i suspect crossteam . name is either empty or not what we expect . yes , i have done this . and some of the loop works . i output e . g . if crossteam . ho_details and i get nothing . although this is indeed filled . i do go into the else-loop , and here i can print stuff . but the if-test on any of the variables inside the crossteam pages , e . g . crossteam . ho_organizers does not kick in since the loop sees them as empty . so i am puzzled why i am not managing to access the correct variables . where can i find the code ? (repo/branch) . i think annefou managed to fix it now . thanks a lot for your help , really appreciate it . i will fiddle a bit more , and if i still do not get it , i will probably just give up for now :slightly_smiling_face: . what was the problem ? so think we found the problem being: in the else section of the if-loop , does not seem to be looping over the files we thought . but if we added an extra if-test to check the name variable inside the files we were ok . (so a check for crossteam . name == \\u201chands-on\\u201d for instance) maikenp . ack . sorry , there was an issue booking rooms for our hpc course , so i had to move the hpc course to march 21 - 23 . so i will not be available march 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , very sorry about that . <@u23htrtjt> . <@u2k0z6mdg> ok . apparently the room is difficult to come by . would you be offended if i go ahead and lock those dates anyway ? there was a cancellation by \"uurtio viivi\" for the workshop , how do i record that . <@u23htrtjt>: i can understand that , not offended . great , then we\\'ll just use other teachers and i\\'ll lock the date . this is great because now we can advertise in next week\\'s event . have a look on the google drive under workshops . there is one file with a big spreadsheet , scroll all the way down and either mark it there that he cancelled or remove his row . it would be super good if the registration page is up by then since people only register during short term memory phase . of course it depends on me or thor to set up the registration form . but i would welcome help with the website . found it . thanks for taking care of it ! we need to soon make a decision about remaining workshops (thread) . <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/> . turku , oslo are set . i think we should keep reykjav\\xedk . is trondheim set ? do we have resources to do more ? if yes , should we replace odense and uppsala by lund and kiruna where we have interested local support ? see also <https://docs . google . com/document/d/1a5meleqvuonjnhzpjniq2tacq9wtgf58bzbobfia0z0/> . we can also discuss this on dec 18 but i would like to have a decision until then otherwise it will be hard to decide or discuss before second half of january . my feeling is that the steering group understands if we skip some workshops since we have over-delivered workshops up to this point . i think maybe we should skip one without replacing it , and then possibly swap locations for one or two . i agree , my feeling as well - also i would like to have one workshop where we meet and work together on the material and bounce ideas around . regarding uppsala , i\\u2019m waiting for a reply from someone from uppmax whether they can help with local arrangements , so let\\u2019s wait and see what they say . in any case , it will probably be easy to fully book a workshop in uppsala , researchers there are very keen on workshops it seems . and it would be dominated by bioinformatics people . it\\'s a good hub , same goes for trondheim but i don\\'t think we can do all the workshops - also trondheim is near if it is february . shall i set up a registrations typeform page for turku ? go ahead . maybe we should open the registration during the course or something similar ? and <@u0kv7fvnv> i\\'ll put up the dates and venue today or tomorrow . no , so let\\u2019s decide one workshop that we skip . my first suggestion is odense . yes - it is the one where we have least local support . awesome ! thanks ! (and punishing the danes a little for their ineffective dissemination channels ;-) . so which other workshops are still undecided , trondheim and uppsala ? done , the url is <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/to/sux4j7> . is there a university in kiruna ? :slightly_smiling_face: . about trondheim , <@u2k0egsc8> did some work - i am sorry i forgot the latest status of that workshop . kiruna: no idea but we were contacted by people there who would be happy to host a workshop . i have twittered about the ntnu event already . reserved room from 27 feb to 1 march . i am also working on a distance education setup for the ntnu event . if you don\\u2019t mind of course . ntnu has 3 campuses , trondheim , gjoevik and aalesund . my plan is to have up to 25 participants in trondheim , and at most 10 from gjoevik and at most 10 from aalesund . i will test this setup in january . but then we need to put this out on the website and also open registration asap , in 2018 it might be too late . right , asap will be . this leaves us with the following degrees of freedom: instead of odense and uppsala we do 0 , 1 , or 2 workshops . the postcards have been delivered ! nice ! :slightly_smiling_face: . <@u23htrtjt> i added the typeform link , changed reg from closed to open , and merged the pr . should we announce to people in the mailing list asap ? i confirmed the reservation today but haven\\'t received a confirmation for my confirmation yet . ah yes , that\\u2019s what we\\u2019ve promised to do . so maybe set to closed and email with the direct link tomorrow when i will likely get the second confirmation . you mean the \\u201cnotify me of upcoming workshops\\u201d list , right ? yes . ok i\\u2019ll close again . done . ok , good to have it narrowed down . i\\u2019m not sure what\\u2019s best . we should probably all discuss it in a meeting soon before making a final decision . ok let\\'s talk about it on the 18th . any final arrangements for next week ? what\\'s the arrival schedule of people / do you need or want anything before tu morning ? and how many people to preliminary order coffee/tea for ? thanks a lot richard ! i arrive monday 5 pm in helsinki . after few cancellations we are down to 42 participants , not counting the instructors/helpers . can i ask you to send a pull request to this file listing the helper so that they get acknowledged ? <https://raw . githubusercontent . com/coderefinery/coderefinery . org/gh-pages/_workshops/2017-12-12-espoo . md> . alternatively you can give me the list of names and i can add them . i\\'ll do the pr . is there a waitlist / can more people come ? should i target 55 people for coffee/tea ? the waiting list is empty - do you know more people who want to attend ? we have 3 seats left . if you know people who wish to attend , they should register here: <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/to/gu9etd> so that we have stats but the registration link should not be announced publicly but it is ok to give it to interested people who wish to attend . speaking of which i probably forgot to share this <https://coderefinery . typeform . com/report/gu9etd/lrmy2cu7m4fxnyef> <@u23htrtjt> <@u2b3dh142> <@u2234ay5a> <@u2k0egsc8> . all-hands meeting cross-team planning (thread) . i got this email: . hi , thank you for all your suggestions for hands-on/show me your tool sessions and speed blogging topics . we have been caught by logistics constrains (limited number of rooms .. ) and had to merge some hands-on sessions . we have converged to the following topics: 1 . how do we use tools for version control and co-editing e . g . google drive , wiki , github ? (coderefinery) 2 . how do we use slack , typeform , zendesk and indico to organise communication and events ? (coderefinery) 3 . how do we use the next cloud service like <http://data . deic . dk|data . deic . dk> ? how can you find and deploy a scientific workflow in the cloud ? (glenna2 , dan still) 4 . how do we use machine learning algorithms to improve our data processing ? (deepdive , matthias obst) we would like to have at least one named person responsible for each session . it is pretty easy for some sessions; for instance , matthias obst (deepdive) appears to be a natural leader for session 4 . however , when we merged several topics , we lost track on who should be responsible and in anycases you may want another person in your project to be responsbile for this hands-on/show me your tool session . this hands-on cross-team session is about showing and sharing knowledge/skills so we would appreciate to highlight synergies between projects and even have shared-responsability for some topics . if you (or one of your project member) are interested in leading/co-leading one of this session , could you tell us as soon as possible , no later than 15th of december . do not hesistate to contact <#c5yk6376g|ahm-planning> on neic slack channel or to reply to this email if you have any questions . more information on the crossteam sessions can be found at <https://neicnordic . github . io/ahm18 . neic . nordforsk . org/crossteam/\\u200b> on behalf of the ahm organization team , anne . i suggested anne to merge 1) and 2) - not clear to me why they are separate . they ask us to specify a session lead for 1 and 2 (which will hopefully become one thing) . who would like to lead this event ? those are some nice stats . re: extra people , i have occasionally heard some people who may want to come , but i will have to remember/find them again . i can probably get 3 though , just will take some time . but i also think that 42 people are really good so we don\\'t have to try too hard to get more but if somebody contacts you , then we have at least 3 more . sounds good ... one helper may be promoted to learner for later days , which fills one . can you forward installation instruction email to me ? i guess it\\'s pointer to site but maybe good to see anyway . the email sent out was this: . [coderefinery] workshop next week dear all , we will soon meet at the coderefinery workshop in espoo/aalto . if it turns out that you cannot attend , please inform <mailto:support@coderefinery . org|support@coderefinery . org> as early as possible so that we can give the seat to persons on the waiting list . before arriving at the workshop , please follow the installation instructions to install and configure software and accounts that we will use during the workshop , see the big red \"software requirements\" on this page: <http://coderefinery . org/workshops/2017-12-12-espoo/> if you run into trouble , do not hesitate to ask by writing to <mailto:support@coderefinery . org|support@coderefinery . org> . if you figure out a better way to install things , please help us to improve the material: <https://github . com/coderefinery/installation> looking forward to seeing you next week , radovan bast . maybe then i should also pr the aalto-specific instructions link to the workshop page ? oh i am sorry i forgot that . i promised to do that , sorry - i will take care of it . i will send another email to people notifying them about that . can you please remind me the url you created ? <http://scicomp . aalto . fi/news/coderefinery . html> . sent , sorry again . fyi i wrote a git repo migration guide . <http://coderefinery . org/repository/moving/> . we might get some support requests concerning that from our local users at uit , in doubt you can leave the tickets to me . thanks ! good question . in principle i could , but maybe it\\u2019s better if we discuss it more and have two of us involved . looks very clear . what time do people arrive next week ? should i expect to meet anyone monday night ? i am happy to be involved but wanted somebody else to shape it and make decisions . <@u82u00n6s> i might be interested in testing the display set-up on monday . ofc i work over in keilaranta so it shouldn\\'t be too much of an effort . richard , we should have dinner together next week , whenever fits best for you . <@u23htrtjt> , currently schedule says free all day monday so take your pick (but not 1230-1430 , other meeting) . <@u0kv7fvnv> , i\\'m most easily free tu or th (mo and we finnish class at 1900) . i\\'m asking other science-it people , but it may be harder for them in evening , but they will do lunch some day . ok for lunch , for dinner tue seems best . i\\'ll tentatively schedule tuesday then , but i will be flexible . oh , what times for the coffee breaks ? currently they have 10:30 and 15:00 . i imagine we have flexibility the day before . for first day , 55 people . <@u0kv7fvnv> should we discuss migrating gitlab instance while physically colocated next week ? or alternately start here and handle the hard questions face to face ? ok but this may cut out anders . we can talk about it but then also need to somehow include anders . based on a quick chat with him i\\'m not sure how much more than the general outline i drafted he needs . i think the breaks are very reasonable , thank you . ok - then we can discuss it next week . as for my part i think we can break almost whenever . how many cancellations/empty seats do we have ? i have promised at least 1 person at csc that they could attend and if we have seats i\\'ll advertise more on monday . last i heard 3 , but i\\'m also searching for others who may want to come . my wife . gave birth to a baby girl yesterday , little earlier than expected . so i will be away for a while . so can some one answer the ticket about setting up python for the workshop . congratulations , sabry , best wishes for your family ! thank you . wonderful news ! congratulations ! don\\'t worry about the ticket . wonderful news , congratulations sabry !!'"
